The Hearts are broken into four categories, each with a corresponding color and unique keyword: Vicious ( , Offensive power), Brutal ( , Defensive power), Devious ( , Utility power), and Wrathful ( , Super). Defeated Malignant Monsters will drop a Heart that corresponds to the monster’s color. Below you’ll find a full list of each Malignant Heart broken out by Class. For this example, the stats you see reflect what a character would receive as a drop. As your Seasonal character grows in Level, so too will the power of the Malignant Hearts that drop for them. Unless specified, the Heart can be acquired by playing in any World Tier in the Seasonal Realm. As you encounter more menacing Malignant Creatures, so too will the strength of their Malignant Hearts grow. Any Heart that you don’t wish to keep can be of a corresponding color. Ichor is a resource that allows for the creation and upgrade of Malignant Hearts and can also be harvested from lesser Malignant Monsters. Salvaging each Vicious, Brutal, and Devious Heart will provide you with 5-15 Ichor, with Wrathful hearts providing 2-5 Ichor of all other Heart types. Creating a random Heart of a specific type costs 35 Ichor of the other two primary-colored Hearts. For example, if you wanted to craft a Vicious heart, you would need 35 Brutal Ichor and 35 Devious Ichor. In return, you would receive a random Vicious heart that scales to the Level of your character. The random Heart you create will always either be for your specific Class or Class-agnostic. One of the best places to acquire Malignant Hearts are in the new , highly replayable Dungeons teeming with fearsome foes to eradicate. While inside, you’ll need to risk life and limb to defeat feral Malignant Monsters while navigating this dank system of tunnels. In total, there are 6 dungeons spread across Sanctuary that make up the Malignant Tunnel system. After putting mobs of Malignant Monsters down, you’ll come across two —one will always be Wrathful and the other will be a different Heart type depending on the dungeon. Using , a special Item crafted at Cormond’s Wagon, players can interact with Outgrowths of the same type, causing them to summon a Fully Corrupted enemy. If you can overcome the summoned foe, you’ll receive a Malignant Heart that matches the monster's type.
