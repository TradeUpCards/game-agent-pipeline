None of the new Sorcerer Aspects are worth talking about and are a joke. Season 6 brings a Wave of options for the Necromancer enjoyers out there. Ultimate Skills are finally on the table for powerful endgame options, with many of our Core Skills gaining tons of damage and new tools for handling every content type. The Builds currently on the rise are . During early game and Leveling, Minion builds will still perform very well, but they sadly fall off in the Endgame. RIP to Minion Necro. Similarly, basically feel off the face of Sanctuary... but there's whispers of a Late Game focused focused build that is quite powerful.
