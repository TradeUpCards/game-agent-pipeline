Read on to learn more from Adam Fletcher's posts. Vessel of Hatred is now live, good luck may your queue be short and crashes be few! We have some late breaking news for our launch for Vessel of Hatred. We are looking at a small delay for launch due to a small technical issue on our end. We are still expecting Vessel of Hatred to launch this evening, but we will need some additional time to ensure we have every player start at the exact same time across all platforms. At 4pm PDT, we will begin locking out new logins for Diablo IV. Players already logged in prior to 4pm PDT will still be in-game on Patch 1.5.2, but they should expect to lose connection to the game over time while we do additional work to get the simultaneous launch prepared. We apologize for the late breaking news on the time shift, but this is an important step we need to make to ensure every player can start their journey through Nahantu together. We will be providing updates in this thread as they become available. We will have a few items that will not be able to drop at the launch of Vessel of Hatred while we do some additional tuning on those items. The goal is to have these reworked and adjusted when we do reintroduce them. We plan on having these available again in a future update client patch shortly after launch. Some of the inaccessible items show up in our guides and variants. We'll be adding to all guides recommending these items and including alternatives when possible. Remember to pin the guide to be notified of future updates! We hope you enjoy the Season of Hatred with the aid of our guides. The is preparing to update our guides to keep pace with the Season 6 meta as it evolves. Stay tuned for more news about Hotfixes and other updates coming to Vessel of Hatred.
