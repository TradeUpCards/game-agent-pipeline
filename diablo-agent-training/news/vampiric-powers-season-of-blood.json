With all that stated, let's get into it! These Powers are the main content of Season 2. During the seasonal questline, we will be assisted by in our adventures. Lilith's Blood protects us from the infliction that has taken so many before us. In the end, we'll go after and take out the leader of this threat, To help us, we will be able to obtain Vampiric Powers from many different sources. These powers can bolster your damage or defensive abilities. Similarly, they can add large amounts of Utility and even interact with the new (Seasonal) ability - . We'll touch on that a little later. Vampiric Powers are not a \"set it and forget it\" type system. There are several steps involving other components to unlock these Powers and upgrade them to their max potential. You get Vampiric Powers through two main methods during the season. The first is through the new season only progression system - Hunter's Acclaim. Hunter's Acclaim is tied to events and actions you do during the Blood Harvest Event.

Now that we know what Vampiric Powers are and where to get them, let's talk about the last part before we bring it home. We need to farm Pact Armor and get our Pacts in order to activate our Powers to use! During the course of the season, while killing Shadow Vampirers, taking part in the Blood Harvest Event, or climbing the Hunter's Acclaim reward tiers, you can get a piece of Armor with Pacts on it. There are three different types of Pacts you will need to keep track of: In addition, depending on the rarity of gear you have, you can have a max amount of Pacts per item: Lastly, Pacts can only roll or be applied to Armor ( ) not Weapons or Jewelry. This means that you have a max of 25 Pacts. You can swap Pacts around to activate as many Vampiric Powers as possible. If a piece of Pact Armor is well rolled, but doesn't have the correct Pacts you need, there is a way to fix this! can be used to wipe away ALL Pacts on a piece of Pact Armor.
