There’s a few ways to improve your chances of finding a Horadric Strongroom within Nightmare Dungeons: How to enter a Horadric Strongroom: Once in the Strongroom, you’ll have a few decisions to make: Within the Strongroom, you’ll have a limited-time to earn as much Horadric Attunement as possible. On leaving the Strongroom, you’ll have the option to select a Horadric cache which scales its rewards based off the amount of Horadric Attunement earned within the Strongroom. Nightmares have a way of seeping into the marrow of your mind, sinking you deeper into the gaping despair of their hold. In Sins of the Horadrim, a new endgame challenge beckons you to descend further into the depths of agony for the ultimate test. Escalation Nightmares are a new endgame activity that throws you into a chain of three Nightmare dungeons.

    "content": "Season 9: Sins of the Horadrim introduces a new way to interact with your powers, granting access to powerful Spellcrafting abilities to create incredible new combinations. Through three key pillars, Horadric Spells provides novel ways to customize and build power at your fingertips. Three different potent elements combine to create these intense spells: Catalysts, Infusions, and Arcana. There are untold possibilities through all the different combinations of Catalysts, Infusions and Arcana. To build your Horadric Spell, you can equip a main Catalyst, an Infusion to support, and three Arcana to augment and build your spell. Each element contributes to your overall spell, allowing you to tinker and build incredible possibilities. This is your chance to really experiment and wield Horadric magic with untold potential. Use the PTR Vendor Mrak to gain access to these elements of Horadric Spellcraft, which is the only way to access them before the Season starts. On Season launch the Wayfinder, Catalysts, and Infusions will be earned through the Seasonal Questline, while Arcana will be found through exploring Nightmare Dungeons. The main source of power for your Horadric spell Astral Magic Arcane Magic Arcane Magic Astral Magic Astral Magic These incantations imbue your Catalyst with power and magic. Your Spell Catalyst now deals Fire and or Burning damage. Your Spell Catalyst now deals Shadow and or Corrupting damage. Your Spell Catalyst now deals Cold and or Frostbiting damage. Your Spell Catalyst now deals Poison and or Poisoning damage. Your Spell Catalyst now deals Lightning and or Sparking damage. Equip up to three different Arcana to modify your Catalyst in many ways.

Use your Wayfinder to search for these rare repositories of Horadric knowledge, then fight your way through the bloodthirsty demons within. Once the Strongroom is unsealed, there will only be a limited amount of time to complete the Strongroom before the valuables are sealed away forever. Slay demons and satiate Horadric Pillars within to bolster your ability to earn Horadric Attunement, which can be used to grant illustrious rewards. There’s a few ways to improve your chances of finding a Horadric Strongroom within Nightmare Dungeons: How to enter a Horadric Strongroom: Once in the Strongroom, you’ll have a few decisions to make: Within the Strongroom, you’ll have a limited-time to earn as much Horadric Attunement as possible. On leaving the Strongroom, you’ll have the option to select a Horadric cache which scales its rewards based off the amount of Horadric Attunement earned within the Strongroom. Nightmares have a way of seeping into the marrow of your mind, sinking you deeper into the gaping despair of their hold. In Sins of the Horadrim, a new endgame challenge beckons you to descend further into the depths of agony for the ultimate test. Escalation Nightmares are a new endgame activity that throws you into a chain of three Nightmare dungeons. The nightmares escalate as you go through each Dungeon, as each Nightmare Dungeons affixes stacks onto the next Dungeons as you continue through. As the difficulty increases, so do the rewards. Manage to fight your way through all three, and waiting for you at the end is a date with the Exalted version of Astaroth himself. To start an Escalating Nightmare, you’ll first need an Escalation Sigil which can be obtained as a reward from Horadric caches granted from Strongrooms starting in Torment I. Activating this dungeon sigil grants you access to the first Nightmare Dungeon in the chain. On completion of the first Nightmare Dungeon in the Escalation, a Horadric Portal will spawn which displays the affix information for the next dungeon. On completion of the third sequential Nightmare Dungeon, you’ll finally be transported to Astaroth’s Lair. A familiar face and one hellishly good boy await you at the end of your Nightmare Escalation. Face Astaroth and the monstrous Amalgam with a new, challenging twist. As the battle unfolds, Astaroth will shed his mount, splitting into two terrifying bosses. Maneuver and learn their new deadly combos to defeat Astaroth. If you slay the Amalgam before Astaroth, the hound of Hell goes into a resurrection state but the Amalgam can’t be slayed will his Master still lives. After a brief time, the Amalgam will recover and rise to rejoin the fight. Slaying these two be a test of your mettle on the battlefield, fear this acolyte of Mephisto and the destructive power he wields. The dungeons of Sanctuary often sit idle, allowing the monstrous forces within to slowly mutate, changing slowly and providing new horrors to slay through. In Sins of the Horadrim, we are shaking up Dungeons in several ways that affect Sanctuary far beyond the Season.

Once the Strongroom is unsealed, there will only be a limited amount of time to complete the Strongroom before the valuables are sealed away forever. Slay demons and satiate Horadric Pillars within to bolster your ability to earn Horadric Attunement, which can be used to grant illustrious rewards. There’s a few ways to improve your chances of finding a Horadric Strongroom within Nightmare Dungeons: How to enter a Horadric Strongroom: Once in the Strongroom, you’ll have a few decisions to make: Within the Strongroom, you’ll have a limited-time to earn as much Horadric Attunement as possible. On leaving the Strongroom, you’ll have the option to select a Horadric cache which scales its rewards based off the amount of Horadric Attunement earned within the Strongroom. Nightmares have a way of seeping into the marrow of your mind, sinking you deeper into the gaping despair of their hold. In Sins of the Horadrim, a new endgame challenge beckons you to descend further into the depths of agony for the ultimate test. Escalation Nightmares are a new endgame activity that throws you into a chain of three Nightmare dungeons. The nightmares escalate as you go through each Dungeon, as each Nightmare Dungeons affixes stacks onto the next Dungeons as you continue through. As the difficulty increases, so do the rewards. Manage to fight your way through all three, and waiting for you at the end is a date with the Exalted version of Astaroth himself. To start an Escalating Nightmare, you’ll first need an Escalation Sigil which can be obtained as a reward from Horadric caches granted from Strongrooms starting in Torment I. Activating this dungeon sigil grants you access to the first Nightmare Dungeon in the chain. On completion of the first Nightmare Dungeon in the Escalation, a Horadric Portal will spawn which displays the affix information for the next dungeon. On completion of the third sequential Nightmare Dungeon, you’ll finally be transported to Astaroth’s Lair. A familiar face and one hellishly good boy await you at the end of your Nightmare Escalation. Face Astaroth and the monstrous Amalgam with a new, challenging twist. As the battle unfolds, Astaroth will shed his mount, splitting into two terrifying bosses. Maneuver and learn their new deadly combos to defeat Astaroth. If you slay the Amalgam before Astaroth, the hound of Hell goes into a resurrection state but the Amalgam can’t be slayed will his Master still lives. After a brief time, the Amalgam will recover and rise to rejoin the fight. Slaying these two be a test of your mettle on the battlefield, fear this acolyte of Mephisto and the destructive power he wields. The dungeons of Sanctuary often sit idle, allowing the monstrous forces within to slowly mutate, changing slowly and providing new horrors to slay through. In Sins of the Horadrim, we are shaking up Dungeons in several ways that affect Sanctuary far beyond the Season. First off, you can now activate Nightmare Sigils from within Nightmare Dungeons once the dungeon is complete. You no longer need to exit the dungeon to enter a new Nightmare Dungeon. In addition to Strongrooms and Escalating Nightmares, a new set of Affixes have been added to Nightmare Dungeons to make them more rewarding. Each basic Nightmare Sigil will now include a positive affix from this refreshed and expanded pool of positive affixes. Horadric Reserves Equipment Delve Power Shrines Miscellaneous Known for their incredible ability as Mages, the Horadrim possess the ability to refine stone into powerful artifacts to aid them in their quest. Upon reaching Torment I, Horadric Tomes can appear as rewards from completed Strongrooms. Horadric Tomes are consumable items that give you the ability to craft socketable Horadric Jewels at Wayfinders. These powerful gems grant a variety of alluring powers and effects, from empowering your Horadric Spell, making enemies explode with elemental damage, and more. Horadric Jewels can be crafted using Horadric Phials and Gem Fragments, and can be socketed in Amulets and both Ring slots.

You gain 6%[x] primary stat, 8%[x] maximum life and you are always Unhindered. However, you will be hunted in Sanctuary's darkest places by Jewel Guardians who were entombed to protect this relic.

There’s a few ways to improve your chances of finding a Horadric Strongroom within Nightmare Dungeons: How to enter a Horadric Strongroom: Once in the Strongroom, you’ll have a few decisions to make: Within the Strongroom, you’ll have a limited-time to earn as much Horadric Attunement as possible.

In Sins of the Horadrim, a new endgame challenge beckons you to descend further into the depths of agony for the ultimate test. Escalation Nightmares are a new endgame activity that throws you into a chain of three Nightmare dungeons. The nightmares escalate as you go through each Dungeon, as each Nightmare Dungeons affixes stacks onto the next Dungeons as you continue through. As the difficulty increases, so do the rewards. Manage to fight your way through all three, and waiting for you at the end is a date with the Exalted version of Astaroth himself. To start an Escalating Nightmare, you’ll first need an Escalation Sigil which can be obtained as a reward from Horadric caches granted from Strongrooms starting in Torment I. Activating this dungeon sigil grants you access to the first Nightmare Dungeon in the chain. On completion of the first Nightmare Dungeon in the Escalation, a Horadric Portal will spawn which displays the affix information for the next dungeon. On completion of the third sequential Nightmare Dungeon, you’ll finally be transported to Astaroth’s Lair. A familiar face and one hellishly good boy await you at the end of your Nightmare Escalation. Face Astaroth and the monstrous Amalgam with a new, challenging twist. As the battle unfolds, Astaroth will shed his mount, splitting into two terrifying bosses. Maneuver and learn their new deadly combos to defeat Astaroth. If you slay the Amalgam before Astaroth, the hound of Hell goes into a resurrection state but the Amalgam can’t be slayed will his Master still lives. After a brief time, the Amalgam will recover and rise to rejoin the fight. Slaying these two be a test of your mettle on the battlefield, fear this acolyte of Mephisto and the destructive power he wields. The dungeons of Sanctuary often sit idle, allowing the monstrous forces within to slowly mutate, changing slowly and providing new horrors to slay through. In Sins of the Horadrim, we are shaking up Dungeons in several ways that affect Sanctuary far beyond the Season. First off, you can now activate Nightmare Sigils from within Nightmare Dungeons once the dungeon is complete. You no longer need to exit the dungeon to enter a new Nightmare Dungeon. In addition to Strongrooms and Escalating Nightmares, a new set of Affixes have been added to Nightmare Dungeons to make them more rewarding. Each basic Nightmare Sigil will now include a positive affix from this refreshed and expanded pool of positive affixes. Horadric Reserves Equipment Delve Power Shrines Miscellaneous Known for their incredible ability as Mages, the Horadrim possess the ability to refine stone into powerful artifacts to aid them in their quest.

Slay demons and satiate Horadric Pillars within to bolster your ability to earn Horadric Attunement, which can be used to grant illustrious rewards. There’s a few ways to improve your chances of finding a Horadric Strongroom within Nightmare Dungeons: How to enter a Horadric Strongroom: Once in the Strongroom, you’ll have a few decisions to make: Within the Strongroom, you’ll have a limited-time to earn as much Horadric Attunement as possible. On leaving the Strongroom, you’ll have the option to select a Horadric cache which scales its rewards based off the amount of Horadric Attunement earned within the Strongroom. Nightmares have a way of seeping into the marrow of your mind, sinking you deeper into the gaping despair of their hold. In Sins of the Horadrim, a new endgame challenge beckons you to descend further into the depths of agony for the ultimate test. Escalation Nightmares are a new endgame activity that throws you into a chain of three Nightmare dungeons. The nightmares escalate as you go through each Dungeon, as each Nightmare Dungeons affixes stacks onto the next Dungeons as you continue through. As the difficulty increases, so do the rewards. Manage to fight your way through all three, and waiting for you at the end is a date with the Exalted version of Astaroth himself. To start an Escalating Nightmare, you’ll first need an Escalation Sigil which can be obtained as a reward from Horadric caches granted from Strongrooms starting in Torment I. Activating this dungeon sigil grants you access to the first Nightmare Dungeon in the chain.

After a brief time, the Amalgam will recover and rise to rejoin the fight. Slaying these two be a test of your mettle on the battlefield, fear this acolyte of Mephisto and the destructive power he wields. The dungeons of Sanctuary often sit idle, allowing the monstrous forces within to slowly mutate, changing slowly and providing new horrors to slay through. In Sins of the Horadrim, we are shaking up Dungeons in several ways that affect Sanctuary far beyond the Season. First off, you can now activate Nightmare Sigils from within Nightmare Dungeons once the dungeon is complete. You no longer need to exit the dungeon to enter a new Nightmare Dungeon.

Slay demons and satiate Horadric Pillars within to bolster your ability to earn Horadric Attunement, which can be used to grant illustrious rewards. There’s a few ways to improve your chances of finding a Horadric Strongroom within Nightmare Dungeons: How to enter a Horadric Strongroom: Once in the Strongroom, you’ll have a few decisions to make: Within the Strongroom, you’ll have a limited-time to earn as much Horadric Attunement as possible. On leaving the Strongroom, you’ll have the option to select a Horadric cache which scales its rewards based off the amount of Horadric Attunement earned within the Strongroom. Nightmares have a way of seeping into the marrow of your mind, sinking you deeper into the gaping despair of their hold. In Sins of the Horadrim, a new endgame challenge beckons you to descend further into the depths of agony for the ultimate test. Escalation Nightmares are a new endgame activity that throws you into a chain of three Nightmare dungeons.

Manage to fight your way through all three, and waiting for you at the end is a date with the Exalted version of Astaroth himself. To start an Escalating Nightmare, you’ll first need an Escalation Sigil which can be obtained as a reward from Horadric caches granted from Strongrooms starting in Torment I. Activating this dungeon sigil grants you access to the first Nightmare Dungeon in the chain. On completion of the first Nightmare Dungeon in the Escalation, a Horadric Portal will spawn which displays the affix information for the next dungeon.

After a brief time, the Amalgam will recover and rise to rejoin the fight. Slaying these two be a test of your mettle on the battlefield, fear this acolyte of Mephisto and the destructive power he wields. The dungeons of Sanctuary often sit idle, allowing the monstrous forces within to slowly mutate, changing slowly and providing new horrors to slay through. In Sins of the Horadrim, we are shaking up Dungeons in several ways that affect Sanctuary far beyond the Season. First off, you can now activate Nightmare Sigils from within Nightmare Dungeons once the dungeon is complete. You no longer need to exit the dungeon to enter a new Nightmare Dungeon. In addition to Strongrooms and Escalating Nightmares, a new set of Affixes have been added to Nightmare Dungeons to make them more rewarding. Each basic Nightmare Sigil will now include a positive affix from this refreshed and expanded pool of positive affixes. Horadric Reserves Equipment Delve Power Shrines Miscellaneous Known for their incredible ability as Mages, the Horadrim possess the ability to refine stone into powerful artifacts to aid them in their quest. Upon reaching Torment I, Horadric Tomes can appear as rewards from completed Strongrooms. Horadric Tomes are consumable items that give you the ability to craft socketable Horadric Jewels at Wayfinders. These powerful gems grant a variety of alluring powers and effects, from empowering your Horadric Spell, making enemies explode with elemental damage, and more.

There’s a few ways to improve your chances of finding a Horadric Strongroom within Nightmare Dungeons: How to enter a Horadric Strongroom: Once in the Strongroom, you’ll have a few decisions to make: Within the Strongroom, you’ll have a limited-time to earn as much Horadric Attunement as possible. On leaving the Strongroom, you’ll have the option to select a Horadric cache which scales its rewards based off the amount of Horadric Attunement earned within the Strongroom.
