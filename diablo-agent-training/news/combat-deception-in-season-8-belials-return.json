    "content": "Deception has descended upon Sanctuary—Belial has returned, or has he? Only the Lord of Lies knows for certain, but that is the truth you must uncover in Season 8: Belial’s Return, wanderer. Starting on , you’ll ally with new friendly faces, harness Boss Powers, and dissipate peculiar Apparition Monsters in your pursuit of the truth. Thank you to everyone who participated in the 2.2.0 Public Test Realm (PTR). We’ve integrated feedback received from the PTR throughout this article. Additional changes made since the PTR’s conclusion are highlighted in blue. Belial’s motive is unknown, but his return has unleashed mysterious Apparition Monsters into Sanctuary. The residents of the land won’t take Belial’s intrusion laying down. Some have taken it upon themselves to investigate these monsters. Meet Sayeena, a retired Vizjerei mage, and Jarius, who claims to be a Cathedral of Light knight. While initially wary of each other, Sayeena and Jarius are dedicated to snuffing out the source of these monsters. You must all band together to unravel Belial’s ploy. Together, you’ll pursue the truth and gain immeasurable power along the way through new Boss Powers. Sanctuary’s fate is in the hands of your trio—failure is not an option. To embark upon the quest, speak to the Stranger located in Kyovashad’s city center next to the Waypoint. You must also have completed Diablo IV’s base game campaign and created a new character on the Seasonal Realm. Using illusory magic, you can now command the very power foes once manipulated to send your wanderer to the dreaded “You Have Died” screen. Boss Powers are a new way to further deepen your builds using abilities siphoned from the carcasses of defeated World, Event, and Lair (formerly Endgame) Bosses. There are 24 Bosses across Sanctuary you can claim Boss Powers from. Each Boss Power has 2 effects—a Main and Modifier—that can be activated depending on the Power Slot you equip it to. You can have up to 1 Main and 3 Modifier Powers active at a time. Whichever Main Boss Power you equip will be the star of the show, the ability you feel most in your build. Whereas the Modifier Boss Powers are meant to bolster the Main Boss Power you selected, taking it to new heights. Tinker with different combinations of Main and Modifier powers to find the mix that best supports your build’s fantasy. Boss Powers can be acquired after killing targeted bosses across Sanctuary for the first time this season. Various World Bosses, new Apparition Incursion event bosses (more information about this can be found further in the article), and even Lilith herself are among the line-up of diabolical titans who provide Boss Powers. A complete list of all 24 Boss Powers, including their Main and Modifier effects can be found below: Wandering Death's Chest Beam (obtained after defeating the World Boss, Wandering Death) Ashava's Poison Breath (obtained after defeating the World Boss, Ashava) Avarice's Explosive Ore (obtained after defeating the World Boss, Avarice the Gold Cursed) Allek's Talons (obtained after defeating this Apparition in the Apparition Incursion event) Beastmaster's Training (obtained after defeating this Apparition in the Apparition Incursion event) Blackmailer's Sabotage (obtained after defeating this Apparition in the Apparition Incursion event) Flesh Reaper's Disruption (obtained after defeating this Apparition in the Apparition Incursion event) Hatred's Embrace's Haste (obtained after defeating this Apparition in the Apparition Incursion event) Kirma's Sparks (obtained after defeating this Apparition in the Apparition Incursion event) Outlaw Sharpshooter's Eye (obtained after defeating this Apparition in the Apparition Incursion event) Sinerat's Flames (obtained after defeating this Apparition in the Apparition Incursion event) Skerg's Toxins (obtained after defeating this Apparition in the Apparition Incursion event) Torusk's Rage (obtained after defeating this Apparition in the Apparition Incursion event) Belial's Crystal Decoy (obtained after defeating Belial in a Lair Boss ambush) Lilith's Wind of Hate (obtained after defeating Lilith) Duriel's Burrow (obtained after defeating the Greater Lair Boss, Duriel) Belial's Eye Beams (obtained after defeating the Exalted Lair Boss Belial, Lord of Lies) Andariel's Flaming Skull (obtained after defeating the Greater Lair Boss, Andariel) Beast in the Ice's Sleet (obtained after defeating the Initiate Lair Boss, Beast in the Ice) Grigoire's Lightning Square (obtained after defeating the Initiate Lair Boss, Grigoire) Lord Zir's Blood Pool (obtained after defeating the Initiate Lair Boss, Lord Zir) Varshan's Life Steal (obtained after defeating the Initiate Lair Boss, Varshan) Urivar's Lobbed Bombs (obtained after defeating the Initiate Lair Boss, Urivar. Requires the Vessel of Hatred expansion) Harbinger of Hatred's Volley (obtained after defeating the Greater Lair Boss, Harbinger of Hatred. Requires the Vessel of Hatred expansion.) Belial makes his first bid for Sanctuary since Lilith met her tragic end. His Apparition Monsters—illusory foot soldiers who sow his lies into reality—have been spotted throughout Sanctuary. You must cull them from your home by participating in the new Apparition Incursion event. Any character playing on any Difficulty Level can participate in this event. The event occurs in a different part of Sanctuary’s wilderness every few minutes, so keep an eye on your map for its current location.

New powerful Unique Items and Legendary Aspects arrive to magnify your renowned demon crushing prowess. Unique Power: Mighty Throw and Steel Grasp now gain multiplicative damage instead of cooldown from Cooldown Reduction and their damage is increased by another 125-250%[x]. Unique Powers: Storm Strike chains to twice as many targets and increases the damage the targets take from other skills by 30-50%[x] for 6 seconds. Unique Powers: Skeleton Warriors explode on death, dealing (200-300%) Physical damage to surrounding enemies. They lose 25% Health per second while in combat. Skeleton Mages take 90% reduced damage and deal 50-100%[x] increased damage. Unique Power: Poison Trap bursts for 150-250% Poison damage when it triggers. If this burst Critically Strikes, you deal 20-40%[x] increased Poison damage for 5 seconds. Unique Power: Enemies take up to 35-55%[x] increased damage based on how much they are Chilled or Staggering. You apply 15% more Chill. Unique Powers: Rushing Claw deals 10-30%[x] increased damage and is empowered based on how many Charges it has when you Cast it: A new way to earn rewards has arrived: Reliquaries! This refresh of the Battle Pass system lets you choose the order in which you earn rewards. A Reliquary is a catalog of rewards that can be purchased using a special currency. To gain access to most Reliquaries, you must first purchase them using Platinum. Within the new Reliquaries system, there are Battle Pass and Event Reliquaries. The former consists of 4 individual Reliquaries you can earn rewards from. Our next season, Belial’s Return, will have these 4 Battle Pass Reliquary options: Belial’s Return, Weapons, Beasts, and Armor. Belial’s Return is a non-premium Battle Pass Reliquary, which means it doesn't require Platinum to access. It even contains a couple hundred Platinum for you to unlock. Weapons, Beasts, and Armor are Premium Reliquaries that can be purchased with Platinum individually for 200/500/800 or as part of the Battle Pass Bundle for 1,000 Platinum. The contents of a Reliquary can be viewed at any time, so look on April 29 and decide how you’d like to spend your Platinum. Battle Pass Reliquaries will be available for the full duration of the season they release with. As for Event Reliquaries, certain milestone events and IP collaborations will have a Reliquary dedicated to them. These will generally be available for shorter periods of time, so you should check on this tab every now and then. Outside of their limited nature, Event Reliquaries will function like their Battle Pass counterparts. Each Reliquary hosts cosmetic rewards that will help you further customize your wanderer. But unlike our previous Battle Pass system, now you will choose the order in which rewards are unlocked. Some Reliquaries have a specific theme to them, which informs the type of cosmetic items you can claim from it. Items in a Reliquary can be claimed in whatever order you desire, and you can claim items from any Reliquary you have access to at any time while it is available.

You can hold up to 99 Favor Tokens at a time and must spend some before you’re able to earn more. Up to 99 Favor Tokens can be saved for future seasons. You may have noticed one item in the above Reliquary has a star icon on it—this is a Bonus Reward. These rewards are automatically unlocked once you have unlocked all other items in that Reliquary using Favor Tokens. Bonus Rewards are just that, a bonus, and don’t require Favor Tokens to claim. Don’t forget to claim them as soon as they are unlocked! The Bonus Reward for each Reliquary this season is a piece of the fabled Guise of the Deceiver Armor set. Complete all 4 Battle Pass Reliquaries to acquire this stunning armor set. Each of the Premium Battle Pass Reliquaries also includes 1 non-premium Weapon Cosmetic that does not require you to pay Platinum to access. It will still cost Favor to unlock these items. A mixed bag containing a Town Portal cosmetic, Weapon Cosmetics, Horse cosmetics, and even Platinum. Gloves belonging to the Guise of the Deceiver armor transmog set are the Bonus Reward. The name really says it all. Weapon cosmetics to support many class fantasies can be found here. Boots belonging to the Guise of the Deceiver armor set are the Bonus Reward. Your animal companion deserves something nice for all the Gold they’ve fetched, and miles travelled across Sanctuary. Mounts, Mount cosmetics, and a Pet can be earned from this Reliquary. Legs belonging to the Guise of the Deceiver armor set are the Bonus Reward. In a world with snarling monstrosities, armor truly makes the wanderer. Cosmetic Armor Sets for each class, and a Town Portal cosmetic can be earned from this Reliquary. The Chest and Helm belonging to the Guise of the Deceiver armor set are the Bonus Reward. Fully completing each Reliquary is no easy feat. May the Guise of the Deceiver armor set be a token of your accomplishment. Drive fear into the blackened hearts of the Burning Hell’s ranks as a glimmering warrior of Sanctuary. I know, we also thought the Guise of the Deceiver armor set would look cooler with wings.

To gain access to most Reliquaries, you must first purchase them using Platinum. Within the new Reliquaries system, there are Battle Pass and Event Reliquaries.

Our next season, Belial’s Return, will have these 4 Battle Pass Reliquary options: Belial’s Return, Weapons, Beasts, and Armor. Belial’s Return is a non-premium Battle Pass Reliquary, which means it doesn't require Platinum to access. It even contains a couple hundred Platinum for you to unlock. Weapons, Beasts, and Armor are Premium Reliquaries that can be purchased with Platinum individually for 200/500/800 or as part of the Battle Pass Bundle for 1,000 Platinum. The contents of a Reliquary can be viewed at any time, so look on April 29 and decide how you’d like to spend your Platinum. Battle Pass Reliquaries will be available for the full duration of the season they release with. As for Event Reliquaries, certain milestone events and IP collaborations will have a Reliquary dedicated to them. These will generally be available for shorter periods of time, so you should check on this tab every now and then. Outside of their limited nature, Event Reliquaries will function like their Battle Pass counterparts. Each Reliquary hosts cosmetic rewards that will help you further customize your wanderer. But unlike our previous Battle Pass system, now you will choose the order in which rewards are unlocked. Some Reliquaries have a specific theme to them, which informs the type of cosmetic items you can claim from it.

    "heading": "Confront Belial in the Lord of Lies",
    "content": "Belial’s motive is unknown, but his return has unleashed mysterious Apparition Monsters into Sanctuary. The residents of the land won’t take Belial’s intrusion laying down. Some have taken it upon themselves to investigate these monsters. Meet Sayeena, a retired Vizjerei mage, and Jarius, who claims to be a Cathedral of Light knight. While initially wary of each other, Sayeena and Jarius are dedicated to snuffing out the source of these monsters. You must all band together to unravel Belial’s ploy. Together, you’ll pursue the truth and gain immeasurable power along the way through new Boss Powers. Sanctuary’s fate is in the hands of your trio—failure is not an option. To embark upon the quest, speak to the Stranger located in Kyovashad’s city center next to the Waypoint. You must also have completed Diablo IV’s base game campaign and created a new character on the Seasonal Realm. Using illusory magic, you can now command the very power foes once manipulated to send your wanderer to the dreaded “You Have Died” screen. Boss Powers are a new way to further deepen your builds using abilities siphoned from the carcasses of defeated World, Event, and Lair (formerly Endgame) Bosses. There are 24 Bosses across Sanctuary you can claim Boss Powers from. Each Boss Power has 2 effects—a Main and Modifier—that can be activated depending on the Power Slot you equip it to. You can have up to 1 Main and 3 Modifier Powers active at a time. Whichever Main Boss Power you equip will be the star of the show, the ability you feel most in your build. Whereas the Modifier Boss Powers are meant to bolster the Main Boss Power you selected, taking it to new heights. Tinker with different combinations of Main and Modifier powers to find the mix that best supports your build’s fantasy. Boss Powers can be acquired after killing targeted bosses across Sanctuary for the first time this season. Various World Bosses, new Apparition Incursion event bosses (more information about this can be found further in the article), and even Lilith herself are among the line-up of diabolical titans who provide Boss Powers. A complete list of all 24 Boss Powers, including their Main and Modifier effects can be found below: Wandering Death's Chest Beam (obtained after defeating the World Boss, Wandering Death) Ashava's Poison Breath (obtained after defeating the World Boss, Ashava) Avarice's Explosive Ore (obtained after defeating the World Boss, Avarice the Gold Cursed) Allek's Talons (obtained after defeating this Apparition in the Apparition Incursion event) Beastmaster's Training (obtained after defeating this Apparition in the Apparition Incursion event) Blackmailer's Sabotage (obtained after defeating this Apparition in the Apparition Incursion event) Flesh Reaper's Disruption (obtained after defeating this Apparition in the Apparition Incursion event) Hatred's Embrace's Haste (obtained after defeating this Apparition in the Apparition Incursion event) Kirma's Sparks (obtained after defeating this Apparition in the Apparition Incursion event) Outlaw Sharpshooter's Eye (obtained after defeating this Apparition in the Apparition Incursion event) Sinerat's Flames (obtained after defeating this Apparition in the Apparition Incursion event) Skerg's Toxins (obtained after defeating this Apparition in the Apparition Incursion event) Torusk's Rage (obtained after defeating this Apparition in the Apparition Incursion event) Belial's Crystal Decoy (obtained after defeating Belial in a Lair Boss ambush) Lilith's Wind of Hate (obtained after defeating Lilith) Duriel's Burrow (obtained after defeating the Greater Lair Boss, Duriel) Belial's Eye Beams (obtained after defeating the Exalted Lair Boss Belial, Lord of Lies) Andariel's Flaming Skull (obtained after defeating the Greater Lair Boss, Andariel) Beast in the Ice's Sleet (obtained after defeating the Initiate Lair Boss, Beast in the Ice) Grigoire's Lightning Square (obtained after defeating the Initiate Lair Boss, Grigoire) Lord Zir's Blood Pool (obtained after defeating the Initiate Lair Boss, Lord Zir) Varshan's Life Steal (obtained after defeating the Initiate Lair Boss, Varshan) Urivar's Lobbed Bombs (obtained after defeating the Initiate Lair Boss, Urivar. Requires the Vessel of Hatred expansion) Harbinger of Hatred's Volley (obtained after defeating the Greater Lair Boss, Harbinger of Hatred. Requires the Vessel of Hatred expansion.) Belial makes his first bid for Sanctuary since Lilith met her tragic end. His Apparition Monsters—illusory foot soldiers who sow his lies into reality—have been spotted throughout Sanctuary. You must cull them from your home by participating in the new Apparition Incursion event. Any character playing on any Difficulty Level can participate in this event. The event occurs in a different part of Sanctuary’s wilderness every few minutes, so keep an eye on your map for its current location.

    "content": "To embark upon the quest, speak to the Stranger located in Kyovashad’s city center next to the Waypoint. You must also have completed Diablo IV’s base game campaign and created a new character on the Seasonal Realm. Using illusory magic, you can now command the very power foes once manipulated to send your wanderer to the dreaded “You Have Died” screen. Boss Powers are a new way to further deepen your builds using abilities siphoned from the carcasses of defeated World, Event, and Lair (formerly Endgame) Bosses. There are 24 Bosses across Sanctuary you can claim Boss Powers from. Each Boss Power has 2 effects—a Main and Modifier—that can be activated depending on the Power Slot you equip it to. You can have up to 1 Main and 3 Modifier Powers active at a time. Whichever Main Boss Power you equip will be the star of the show, the ability you feel most in your build. Whereas the Modifier Boss Powers are meant to bolster the Main Boss Power you selected, taking it to new heights. Tinker with different combinations of Main and Modifier powers to find the mix that best supports your build’s fantasy. Boss Powers can be acquired after killing targeted bosses across Sanctuary for the first time this season. Various World Bosses, new Apparition Incursion event bosses (more information about this can be found further in the article), and even Lilith herself are among the line-up of diabolical titans who provide Boss Powers. A complete list of all 24 Boss Powers, including their Main and Modifier effects can be found below: Wandering Death's Chest Beam (obtained after defeating the World Boss, Wandering Death) Ashava's Poison Breath (obtained after defeating the World Boss, Ashava) Avarice's Explosive Ore (obtained after defeating the World Boss, Avarice the Gold Cursed) Allek's Talons (obtained after defeating this Apparition in the Apparition Incursion event) Beastmaster's Training (obtained after defeating this Apparition in the Apparition Incursion event) Blackmailer's Sabotage (obtained after defeating this Apparition in the Apparition Incursion event) Flesh Reaper's Disruption (obtained after defeating this Apparition in the Apparition Incursion event) Hatred's Embrace's Haste (obtained after defeating this Apparition in the Apparition Incursion event) Kirma's Sparks (obtained after defeating this Apparition in the Apparition Incursion event) Outlaw Sharpshooter's Eye (obtained after defeating this Apparition in the Apparition Incursion event) Sinerat's Flames (obtained after defeating this Apparition in the Apparition Incursion event) Skerg's Toxins (obtained after defeating this Apparition in the Apparition Incursion event) Torusk's Rage (obtained after defeating this Apparition in the Apparition Incursion event) Belial's Crystal Decoy (obtained after defeating Belial in a Lair Boss ambush) Lilith's Wind of Hate (obtained after defeating Lilith) Duriel's Burrow (obtained after defeating the Greater Lair Boss, Duriel) Belial's Eye Beams (obtained after defeating the Exalted Lair Boss Belial, Lord of Lies) Andariel's Flaming Skull (obtained after defeating the Greater Lair Boss, Andariel) Beast in the Ice's Sleet (obtained after defeating the Initiate Lair Boss, Beast in the Ice) Grigoire's Lightning Square (obtained after defeating the Initiate Lair Boss, Grigoire) Lord Zir's Blood Pool (obtained after defeating the Initiate Lair Boss, Lord Zir) Varshan's Life Steal (obtained after defeating the Initiate Lair Boss, Varshan) Urivar's Lobbed Bombs (obtained after defeating the Initiate Lair Boss, Urivar. Requires the Vessel of Hatred expansion) Harbinger of Hatred's Volley (obtained after defeating the Greater Lair Boss, Harbinger of Hatred. Requires the Vessel of Hatred expansion.) Belial makes his first bid for Sanctuary since Lilith met her tragic end. His Apparition Monsters—illusory foot soldiers who sow his lies into reality—have been spotted throughout Sanctuary. You must cull them from your home by participating in the new Apparition Incursion event. Any character playing on any Difficulty Level can participate in this event. The event occurs in a different part of Sanctuary’s wilderness every few minutes, so keep an eye on your map for its current location.

Overcome Belial’s band of illusion spreaders, complete Apparition Incursion events, and slay Bosses across Sanctuary to earn Reputation. This Reputation can be exchanged for long-forgotten caches containing uncommon items, such as a Resplendent Spark, Hoard Keys, and more. New powerful Unique Items and Legendary Aspects arrive to magnify your renowned demon crushing prowess. Unique Power: Mighty Throw and Steel Grasp now gain multiplicative damage instead of cooldown from Cooldown Reduction and their damage is increased by another 125-250%[x]. Unique Powers: Storm Strike chains to twice as many targets and increases the damage the targets take from other skills by 30-50%[x] for 6 seconds. Unique Powers: Skeleton Warriors explode on death, dealing (200-300%) Physical damage to surrounding enemies. They lose 25% Health per second while in combat. Skeleton Mages take 90% reduced damage and deal 50-100%[x] increased damage. Unique Power: Poison Trap bursts for 150-250% Poison damage when it triggers. If this burst Critically Strikes, you deal 20-40%[x] increased Poison damage for 5 seconds. Unique Power: Enemies take up to 35-55%[x] increased damage based on how much they are Chilled or Staggering. You apply 15% more Chill. Unique Powers: Rushing Claw deals 10-30%[x] increased damage and is empowered based on how many Charges it has when you Cast it: A new way to earn rewards has arrived: Reliquaries! This refresh of the Battle Pass system lets you choose the order in which you earn rewards. A Reliquary is a catalog of rewards that can be purchased using a special currency. To gain access to most Reliquaries, you must first purchase them using Platinum. Within the new Reliquaries system, there are Battle Pass and Event Reliquaries. The former consists of 4 individual Reliquaries you can earn rewards from. Our next season, Belial’s Return, will have these 4 Battle Pass Reliquary options: Belial’s Return, Weapons, Beasts, and Armor. Belial’s Return is a non-premium Battle Pass Reliquary, which means it doesn't require Platinum to access. It even contains a couple hundred Platinum for you to unlock. Weapons, Beasts, and Armor are Premium Reliquaries that can be purchased with Platinum individually for 200/500/800 or as part of the Battle Pass Bundle for 1,000 Platinum. The contents of a Reliquary can be viewed at any time, so look on April 29 and decide how you’d like to spend your Platinum. Battle Pass Reliquaries will be available for the full duration of the season they release with. As for Event Reliquaries, certain milestone events and IP collaborations will have a Reliquary dedicated to them. These will generally be available for shorter periods of time, so you should check on this tab every now and then. Outside of their limited nature, Event Reliquaries will function like their Battle Pass counterparts. Each Reliquary hosts cosmetic rewards that will help you further customize your wanderer. But unlike our previous Battle Pass system, now you will choose the order in which rewards are unlocked. Some Reliquaries have a specific theme to them, which informs the type of cosmetic items you can claim from it. Items in a Reliquary can be claimed in whatever order you desire, and you can claim items from any Reliquary you have access to at any time while it is available.

These red, circular tokens called Favor Tokens are how you unlock items from a Reliquary. Favor be earned by slaying monsters and completing quests. At the top of the Reliquaries system menu you’ll see a progress bar indicating how close you are to obtaining your next Favor Token. You can hold up to 99 Favor Tokens at a time and must spend some before you’re able to earn more. Up to 99 Favor Tokens can be saved for future seasons. You may have noticed one item in the above Reliquary has a star icon on it—this is a Bonus Reward. These rewards are automatically unlocked once you have unlocked all other items in that Reliquary using Favor Tokens. Bonus Rewards are just that, a bonus, and don’t require Favor Tokens to claim. Don’t forget to claim them as soon as they are unlocked! The Bonus Reward for each Reliquary this season is a piece of the fabled Guise of the Deceiver Armor set. Complete all 4 Battle Pass Reliquaries to acquire this stunning armor set. Each of the Premium Battle Pass Reliquaries also includes 1 non-premium Weapon Cosmetic that does not require you to pay Platinum to access. It will still cost Favor to unlock these items. A mixed bag containing a Town Portal cosmetic, Weapon Cosmetics, Horse cosmetics, and even Platinum. Gloves belonging to the Guise of the Deceiver armor transmog set are the Bonus Reward. The name really says it all. Weapon cosmetics to support many class fantasies can be found here. Boots belonging to the Guise of the Deceiver armor set are the Bonus Reward. Your animal companion deserves something nice for all the Gold they’ve fetched, and miles travelled across Sanctuary. Mounts, Mount cosmetics, and a Pet can be earned from this Reliquary. Legs belonging to the Guise of the Deceiver armor set are the Bonus Reward. In a world with snarling monstrosities, armor truly makes the wanderer. Cosmetic Armor Sets for each class, and a Town Portal cosmetic can be earned from this Reliquary. The Chest and Helm belonging to the Guise of the Deceiver armor set are the Bonus Reward. Fully completing each Reliquary is no easy feat. May the Guise of the Deceiver armor set be a token of your accomplishment. Drive fear into the blackened hearts of the Burning Hell’s ranks as a glimmering warrior of Sanctuary. I know, we also thought the Guise of the Deceiver armor set would look cooler with wings.

She’ll keep an eye on your back, side, and any other direction you can think of while slaying demons!

Smoldering Ashes will now be earned as Chapter Rewards and for completing objectives in the Season Journey.

Weapons, Beasts, and Armor are Premium Reliquaries that can be purchased with Platinum individually for 200/500/800 or as part of the Battle Pass Bundle for 1,000 Platinum. The contents of a Reliquary can be viewed at any time, so look on April 29 and decide how you’d like to spend your Platinum. Battle Pass Reliquaries will be available for the full duration of the season they release with. As for Event Reliquaries, certain milestone events and IP collaborations will have a Reliquary dedicated to them. These will generally be available for shorter periods of time, so you should check on this tab every now and then. Outside of their limited nature, Event Reliquaries will function like their Battle Pass counterparts. Each Reliquary hosts cosmetic rewards that will help you further customize your wanderer. But unlike our previous Battle Pass system, now you will choose the order in which rewards are unlocked. Some Reliquaries have a specific theme to them, which informs the type of cosmetic items you can claim from it. Items in a Reliquary can be claimed in whatever order you desire, and you can claim items from any Reliquary you have access to at any time while it is available.

This refresh of the Battle Pass system lets you choose the order in which you earn rewards. A Reliquary is a catalog of rewards that can be purchased using a special currency. To gain access to most Reliquaries, you must first purchase them using Platinum. Within the new Reliquaries system, there are Battle Pass and Event Reliquaries. The former consists of 4 individual Reliquaries you can earn rewards from. Our next season, Belial’s Return, will have these 4 Battle Pass Reliquary options: Belial’s Return, Weapons, Beasts, and Armor. Belial’s Return is a non-premium Battle Pass Reliquary, which means it doesn't require Platinum to access. It even contains a couple hundred Platinum for you to unlock. Weapons, Beasts, and Armor are Premium Reliquaries that can be purchased with Platinum individually for 200/500/800 or as part of the Battle Pass Bundle for 1,000 Platinum. The contents of a Reliquary can be viewed at any time, so look on April 29 and decide how you’d like to spend your Platinum. Battle Pass Reliquaries will be available for the full duration of the season they release with. As for Event Reliquaries, certain milestone events and IP collaborations will have a Reliquary dedicated to them. These will generally be available for shorter periods of time, so you should check on this tab every now and then. Outside of their limited nature, Event Reliquaries will function like their Battle Pass counterparts. Each Reliquary hosts cosmetic rewards that will help you further customize your wanderer. But unlike our previous Battle Pass system, now you will choose the order in which rewards are unlocked. Some Reliquaries have a specific theme to them, which informs the type of cosmetic items you can claim from it. Items in a Reliquary can be claimed in whatever order you desire, and you can claim items from any Reliquary you have access to at any time while it is available.

You can hold up to 99 Favor Tokens at a time and must spend some before you’re able to earn more. Up to 99 Favor Tokens can be saved for future seasons. You may have noticed one item in the above Reliquary has a star icon on it—this is a Bonus Reward. These rewards are automatically unlocked once you have unlocked all other items in that Reliquary using Favor Tokens. Bonus Rewards are just that, a bonus, and don’t require Favor Tokens to claim. Don’t forget to claim them as soon as they are unlocked! The Bonus Reward for each Reliquary this season is a piece of the fabled Guise of the Deceiver Armor set. Complete all 4 Battle Pass Reliquaries to acquire this stunning armor set.

Cosmetic Armor Sets for each class, and a Town Portal cosmetic can be earned from this Reliquary. The Chest and Helm belonging to the Guise of the Deceiver armor set are the Bonus Reward. Fully completing each Reliquary is no easy feat. May the Guise of the Deceiver armor set be a token of your accomplishment.

Overcome Belial’s band of illusion spreaders, complete Apparition Incursion events, and slay Bosses across Sanctuary to earn Reputation. This Reputation can be exchanged for long-forgotten caches containing uncommon items, such as a Resplendent Spark, Hoard Keys, and more.

This refresh of the Battle Pass system lets you choose the order in which you earn rewards. A Reliquary is a catalog of rewards that can be purchased using a special currency. To gain access to most Reliquaries, you must first purchase them using Platinum. Within the new Reliquaries system, there are Battle Pass and Event Reliquaries. The former consists of 4 individual Reliquaries you can earn rewards from. Our next season, Belial’s Return, will have these 4 Battle Pass Reliquary options: Belial’s Return, Weapons, Beasts, and Armor. Belial’s Return is a non-premium Battle Pass Reliquary, which means it doesn't require Platinum to access. It even contains a couple hundred Platinum for you to unlock. Weapons, Beasts, and Armor are Premium Reliquaries that can be purchased with Platinum individually for 200/500/800 or as part of the Battle Pass Bundle for 1,000 Platinum. The contents of a Reliquary can be viewed at any time, so look on April 29 and decide how you’d like to spend your Platinum. Battle Pass Reliquaries will be available for the full duration of the season they release with. As for Event Reliquaries, certain milestone events and IP collaborations will have a Reliquary dedicated to them. These will generally be available for shorter periods of time, so you should check on this tab every now and then. Outside of their limited nature, Event Reliquaries will function like their Battle Pass counterparts. Each Reliquary hosts cosmetic rewards that will help you further customize your wanderer. But unlike our previous Battle Pass system, now you will choose the order in which rewards are unlocked. Some Reliquaries have a specific theme to them, which informs the type of cosmetic items you can claim from it. Items in a Reliquary can be claimed in whatever order you desire, and you can claim items from any Reliquary you have access to at any time while it is available.

This refresh of the Battle Pass system lets you choose the order in which you earn rewards. A Reliquary is a catalog of rewards that can be purchased using a special currency. To gain access to most Reliquaries, you must first purchase them using Platinum. Within the new Reliquaries system, there are Battle Pass and Event Reliquaries. The former consists of 4 individual Reliquaries you can earn rewards from. Our next season, Belial’s Return, will have these 4 Battle Pass Reliquary options: Belial’s Return, Weapons, Beasts, and Armor. Belial’s Return is a non-premium Battle Pass Reliquary, which means it doesn't require Platinum to access. It even contains a couple hundred Platinum for you to unlock. Weapons, Beasts, and Armor are Premium Reliquaries that can be purchased with Platinum individually for 200/500/800 or as part of the Battle Pass Bundle for 1,000 Platinum. The contents of a Reliquary can be viewed at any time, so look on April 29 and decide how you’d like to spend your Platinum. Battle Pass Reliquaries will be available for the full duration of the season they release with. As for Event Reliquaries, certain milestone events and IP collaborations will have a Reliquary dedicated to them. These will generally be available for shorter periods of time, so you should check on this tab every now and then. Outside of their limited nature, Event Reliquaries will function like their Battle Pass counterparts. Each Reliquary hosts cosmetic rewards that will help you further customize your wanderer. But unlike our previous Battle Pass system, now you will choose the order in which rewards are unlocked. Some Reliquaries have a specific theme to them, which informs the type of cosmetic items you can claim from it. Items in a Reliquary can be claimed in whatever order you desire, and you can claim items from any Reliquary you have access to at any time while it is available.
