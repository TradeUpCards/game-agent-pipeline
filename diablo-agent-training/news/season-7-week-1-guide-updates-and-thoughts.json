    "content": "Season 7: Season of Witchcraft and the patch 2.1 have been released a week ago! With that in mind, it's time for the to share their Season 7 Week 1 thoughts, findings and guide updates! Since the Season 7 start, the worked hard to keep updated Build Guides for every Diablo 4 class with all the informations discovered live! Predictions for the Barbarian class have been pretty spot on, with everything Earthquake-related currently dominating the meta - the most prominent builds being Leapquake, , and oddly enough, ? Interestingly, the item we thought would be build-enabling, the , hasn't made too great of an initial impression. It started out pretty much doing nothing at all, got fixed, and well... still felt pretty lackluster and often unnecessary. Subsequently, is slowly finding itself unworthy of being on our skill bar, and it isn't impossible that its premiere unique item may soon share the same fate. As far as other builds go... wait - are there other builds? Yeah, they're in the dust and destruction over there, somewhere, surely. But seriously, Earthquake is \"it\" right now. Even with a random assortment of skills, the Rune combined with all of its massive multipliers can make just about any build work. It's a great time to get creative and enjoy the power while we have it. In the coming weeks when the dust has settled, we'll be revisiting our old pals (those \"other builds\") and see how they're holdin' up, and hopefully resist the urge to slap Earthquake stuff on them. Many leveling guides have also been updated! As anticipated, is DOMINATING the druid meta, offscreening hordes of mobs and ladder bosses alike. Though slightly weaker than projected, we still foresee a Pit 150 clear on the horizon for this build, and it's more than sufficient for any content short of this, regardless of the infinite damage scaling bug hotfixed last week. If you're still debating whether or not it's worth it to learn the prerequisite snapshot mechanic for this build, it absolutely is. Though there's a considerable gap between and the next build, there are still plenty of viable endgame options on Druid. zooming through content with its newfound ability to cast while moving. The Druid keeps pace with the best of them, but, in the end, may be lacking in overall damage compared to its peers. , Companion, are all meeting or exceeding pre-season expectations, and are notably trailing the pack. We're still anticipating that newcomer can rise to the top of this group, but are currently working on the finer details of making this build both accessible and reliably strong. Expect an update later this week! Many leveling guides have also been updated! We haven't seen many shifts in Sorcerer builds on the tier list. With enchant losing its benificial bug and retaining the harmful one, the build goes down a tier. On the other hand, Sorcerer now based around Meteorites from Aspect of , turned out slightly better than we expected and went up to B tier. Higher tiers are only open to Greater bug builds and those are very uncomfortable to play and can't do much besides Pit pushing. That being said, it's not all doom and gloom for the Sorcerers. While our builds are very weak compared to top classes, the inter-class balance is quite good. and a few more are all decently strong builds that feel completely fine in Torment 4. With enough investment they can even oneshot Lair Bosses and level their Glyphs to level 100. Many leveling guides have also been updated! It turns out the Necromancer is just as powerful as the speculation made it out to be... with one sad realization. A pretty massive bug has basically cut endgame Minion Necromancer's power in half. While it's still an amazing leveling strategy, the endgame version is not currently up to snuff. The is not properly interacting with damage multipliers on Aspects and elsewhere. The developers are aware. Surprising no one, Necromancer made a huge splash, with our very own already clearing a Tier 150 Pit, along with other big names in the community. Blood Spear is proving to be a hilariously fun and powerful return for Bone Spear enjoyers, and every other build you could want to play is piloting super well in this Season. Many leveling guides have also been updated! is definitely a great addition to many builds, but unfortunately has a few bugs barring it from being used in . Instead we focus our TB build to be around pure Poison Imbuement now with the additional benefits from and Word of Hakan. These are mainly used to trigger other damage buffs and increase Imbuement Ranks so Rain of Arrows itself does not steal TB's show by overshadowing it's damage output. In general the Rain of Arrows build still tops the charts with its damage output, but is not quite as fast to farm with due to it's slow moving arrows. turned out to be a real surprise and is an excellent build to get your Glyphs to 100 or speed through Nightmare Dungeons. While it is not quite as fast as in blasting through the open world and Witchtide, it packs more damage and is quite easy to play. Speaking of Dance of Knives, our build for it got a massive update, improving the damage output and therefore making the transition to Torment 4 a lot easier. We have also included an optional No Snapshot version in the Variants Section. does not have the pushing power deep into the 100s, it certainly still is of the best choices for most farming and T4 activities out of all classes. Another small surprise is Rogue. While very difficult to gear, it's an absurdly fast and strong potent build once you get the Cooldown down low enough! is definitely carrying this one and other direct damage builds, so look out for these. Many leveling guides have also been updated! Spiritborn, as expected, have lost a lot of their former power thanks to some major bug fixes going into Season 7. However, it turns out that not all is just doom and gloom. They are still as adept at speedfarming as ever with various setups simply flying through endgame content and multiple builds capable of raising their glyph levels all the way to 100 without breaking a sweat. In addition to the arsenal of builds that the class started with in Season 6, we have also seen some newcomers emerge. An ultimate-based The Seeker build has shown great promise, pushing way beyond T100 pits with ease, as has an Andariel's Visage based setup going for Noxious Resonance (now added as an extra variant in our Quill Volley Endgame guide). Overall, it appears Spiritborn is in a pretty good spot, sitting in the middle of the pack among the other classes for pushing performance while being faster than most of them for farming. Many leveling guides have also been updated! We hope you enjoy the Season of Witchcraft with the aid of our Season 7 updates. Our focus for the start of Season 7 is to make sure our are solid with all the new Item updates, new features and mechanic changes.

While very difficult to gear, it's an absurdly fast and strong potent build once you get the Cooldown down low enough! is definitely carrying this one and other direct damage builds, so look out for these. Many leveling guides have also been updated! Spiritborn, as expected, have lost a lot of their former power thanks to some major bug fixes going into Season 7. However, it turns out that not all is just doom and gloom. They are still as adept at speedfarming as ever with various setups simply flying through endgame content and multiple builds capable of raising their glyph levels all the way to 100 without breaking a sweat. In addition to the arsenal of builds that the class started with in Season 6, we have also seen some newcomers emerge. An ultimate-based The Seeker build has shown great promise, pushing way beyond T100 pits with ease, as has an Andariel's Visage based setup going for Noxious Resonance (now added as an extra variant in our Quill Volley Endgame guide). Overall, it appears Spiritborn is in a pretty good spot, sitting in the middle of the pack among the other classes for pushing performance while being faster than most of them for farming.

The Druid keeps pace with the best of them, but, in the end, may be lacking in overall damage compared to its peers. , Companion, are all meeting or exceeding pre-season expectations, and are notably trailing the pack. We're still anticipating that newcomer can rise to the top of this group, but are currently working on the finer details of making this build both accessible and reliably strong. Expect an update later this week! Many leveling guides have also been updated! We haven't seen many shifts in Sorcerer builds on the tier list. With enchant losing its benificial bug and retaining the harmful one, the build goes down a tier. On the other hand, Sorcerer now based around Meteorites from Aspect of , turned out slightly better than we expected and went up to B tier. Higher tiers are only open to Greater bug builds and those are very uncomfortable to play and can't do much besides Pit pushing. That being said, it's not all doom and gloom for the Sorcerers. While our builds are very weak compared to top classes, the inter-class balance is quite good. and a few more are all decently strong builds that feel completely fine in Torment 4. With enough investment they can even oneshot Lair Bosses and level their Glyphs to level 100. Many leveling guides have also been updated! It turns out the Necromancer is just as powerful as the speculation made it out to be... with one sad realization. A pretty massive bug has basically cut endgame Minion Necromancer's power in half. While it's still an amazing leveling strategy, the endgame version is not currently up to snuff. The is not properly interacting with damage multipliers on Aspects and elsewhere. The developers are aware. Surprising no one, Necromancer made a huge splash, with our very own already clearing a Tier 150 Pit, along with other big names in the community. Blood Spear is proving to be a hilariously fun and powerful return for Bone Spear enjoyers, and every other build you could want to play is piloting super well in this Season. Many leveling guides have also been updated! is definitely a great addition to many builds, but unfortunately has a few bugs barring it from being used in . Instead we focus our TB build to be around pure Poison Imbuement now with the additional benefits from and Word of Hakan. These are mainly used to trigger other damage buffs and increase Imbuement Ranks so Rain of Arrows itself does not steal TB's show by overshadowing it's damage output. In general the Rain of Arrows build still tops the charts with its damage output, but is not quite as fast to farm with due to it's slow moving arrows. turned out to be a real surprise and is an excellent build to get your Glyphs to 100 or speed through Nightmare Dungeons. While it is not quite as fast as in blasting through the open world and Witchtide, it packs more damage and is quite easy to play. Speaking of Dance of Knives, our build for it got a massive update, improving the damage output and therefore making the transition to Torment 4 a lot easier.
