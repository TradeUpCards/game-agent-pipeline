    "content": "On May 22nd during the Campfire Chat, Blizzard announced the 2.3 PTR and Season 9! Discover Maxroll Team first thoughts about 2.3 PTR notes! Season 8: Belial's Return and the patch 2.2 have been released only a few weeks ago but it is already time to set our eyes on next season! As was predicted going into Season 8, Earthquake builds still reigned supreme despite the heavy nerfs they received (twice). As we approach Season 9's PTR with the only targeted nerf to this playstyle being the paragon node, it seems the trend might continue, as this alone is not nearly enough to dethrone our top performing builds. The only real competitor, , has been obliterated due to various bug fixes and Overpower damage nerfs; the latter also spells doom for much of the already underperforming cast, namely - especially worrying since there aren't any meaningful buffs to these Core Skills in sight as of yet. We will, however, see a rise in popularity of our various Basic Skills. was already fairly well-known within this archetype, but it might have a bit of an identity crisis in the coming Season with the addition of , a pair of shoes that gives the ability to cleave. All of these builds play fairly similarly, but it remains to be seen which one will come out on top in terms of pure power. Our other Basic, , is a bit of an oddball here, but it does show some promise with the addition of . Although it is unlikely that any of these will end up being \"the best\", they do add some much needed variety to the Barbarian's current arsenal. ! Honestly, despite a slew of nerfs that bring pure Cataclysm to less than 5% of its season 8 values, it should continue to stick around as one of the top contenders for Druid. But gone are the days of throwing into any random build for an easy 100%x multiplier. Instead, we'll often leverage , which regains its permanent Unstoppable and now has a healthy cast of supporting , if your build is good at recovering its cooldown and can leverage The changes to and Rabid Bear, along with the introduction of Noxious Spine-Breaker, are intriguing for a Poison-based Werebear build. However, Druids have historically had a difficult time scaling DoTs, and it's going to take some extra love from Tryant Bane and other seasonal effects to see this come to fruition. The basic skill buffs aren't totally meaningless, but basic skill builds were so far behind that these buffs probably don't move the needle for them. Those buffs will probably be most felt while leveling. The upcoming patch comes with heavy nerfs to Key Passives, which affects ... all the Sorcerer builds. That's right, no one is escaping unharmed. Depending on the build, this nerf amounts to somewhere between x4 and x50 less damage dealt or approximately 6 to 16 Pit tiers. On top of that received some personal \"love\" in form of bugfix resulting in another 15x damage loss. The good news is that Lightning Spear was so far above the rest that even with these nerfs it will remain playable, even very good for speedfarming non-Pit content with a fully optimised build. Another positive side of these nerfs is that not every build is going to run Enlightenment, letting us move away from \"wait for buff to deal damage\" type of gameplay. And finally, there's something to look forward to: the new build. Our initial expectation is that it will be strong, maybe even the strongest Sorcerer build! The devs have decided to shake up the entirety of the Necromancer meta with this one simple change... Nerf . Removing the Barrier generation and drastically reducing the damage multiplier makes your decision for a supporting ultimate skill a bit more interesting. We may see a return to the meta of and Shielding Storm aspect, to solve survivability in the endgame. Blood Builds are looking to to regain damage and survival. Minion builds may become even more glass cannon and finally use , while Darkness builds will rely on the Essence Generation of , and look elsewhere for Barrier. Add in the new Unique Minion gloves that seem like one of our first truly transformative items, on the class, and what we have is a very interesting PTR to uncover the meta. Basic Attack enjoyers, rejoice! The changes to and increased base damage of Basic Attacks makes our builds stronger than they were in Season 8! We plan on experimenting with the other Basic Attacks throughout the PTR, so stay tuned for that. was nerfed with changes to Overpower and , it is still looking like one of our strongest builds as it was not dependent by the strength of our Key Passives. Other builds, such as , and more, are significantly impacted by this change and have as a result lost some power compared to their performance in Season 8. Builds that used are not affected by this, so are looking strong as ever with the addition of the Horadric Powers. The new Flurry Helmet has interested our guide writers, but PTR will determine how strong it actually is. We have plenty of subtle changes to our existing guides, so make sure to read the updated guides as we get closer to Season 9 launch. Spiritborn may have a pretty decent season ahead of them. Compared to most other classes, they were nerfed the least, which means that some of the stronger builds like may end up among the best in the game. -based setups are going to feel the game-wide overpower nerfs, others get affected by the change to the key passive, but overall it's looking like there are plenty of solid builds to choose from for Season 9, including the oldschool fan-favorite Evade Spiritborn which was already good in Season 8 and is unaffected by any nerfs. unique also looks very promising to either produce its own dedicated Thorns/Poison proc build or get included in existing Thorns setups like . Depending on the exact mechanics, this may be a contender for a top tier setup. Only the \"buff\" to falls flat and that build is going to remain one of the weakest we currently cover across all classes, while the \"nerf\" to cooldown resets won't have any noticeable impact at all for any endgame build. We hope you enjoy the Season of Belial's Return with the aid of our Season 8 updates. Our focus for the rest of Season 8 is to make sure our are solid with all the new Item updates, new features and mechanic changes.
