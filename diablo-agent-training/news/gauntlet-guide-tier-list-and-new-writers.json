Behind the scenes, we've been getting ready for the Gauntlet, which is finally coming out today! With the Gauntlet, we have our new Resource Guide along with a new Tier List. Both of which will get updates as we learn more. Lastly, the welcome to THREE new writers for the branch The Gauntlet brings a new mode to play to compete against your friends, Clan, and the world! There are a lot of things, small and large, to keep in mind while smashing enemies inside as well as prior to entering. We got you covered in our Gauntlet and Leaderboard Overview linked below. Like clockwork, with the addition of a new system or mode...there comes a new Tier List. This is a preliminary ranking of builds based on OVERALL performance of a specific build against another specific builds of the SAME CLASS. We need to stress that Leaderboards in game only measure any one class against itself, so we did the same in our tier list. In order to find the Gauntlet specifics for a build you are playing, go to the section and look for the Gauntlet variant as seen below: It's always an exciting time when new \"Fresh Meat!\" joins a branch. These three are no exception! We here on the Diablo 4 Team extend a fiery welcome, and hope you enjoy their content here as well.

He holds world records in both Diablo 4 and Diablo 2 and just this season was the number 1 Rogue in the world to hit level 100 in Diablo 4. His focus on the Maxroll team will be contributing to Rogue resource materials and hosting community events, which he has a long history of organizing across many Diablo titles. M1PY is a seasoned Diablo player and content creator from Germany.
