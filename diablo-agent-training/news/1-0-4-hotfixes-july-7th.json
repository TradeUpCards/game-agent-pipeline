    "content": "just went live adjusting a broken interaction with Necromancer's Blood Lance Skill. Later this afternoon another Hotfix will put Uber Unique items back into the game. For those out of the loop, last night it was discovered that Helltide Chests containing helms were dropping Uber Unique items like at an insane rate for Barbarian and Sorcerer Players. Due to this they were temporarily disabled while they investigated the bug. Again Uber Unique's will be reenabled sometime later this afternoon, we'll post another quick post when it happens! If you haven't already, head over to our and select the D4 role in to stay up to date with our content development. Sanctuary here we come!"
