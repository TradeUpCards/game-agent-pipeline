    "content": "just took place. The panel consisting of (Associate Game Designer, Class), (Lead Class Designer) and (Associate Director of Community) discussed Season 2 (Season of Blood), major class balancing, Q&A, along with last minute details before Season 2 goes live on . See all the major points below. The Dev Team talked about how they have five main goals for approaching improvements in Season 2 / Season of Blood. The Dev Team wants to make sure Resistances feel impactful and wanted by the player. In Season 1 Resistances are calculated with inverse multiplicative scaling, essentially you take all your Resistances and multiply them against each other. This means you have higher diminishing returns the more sources, and more of that stat you have. Going into Season 2, they will be additive. This mean that all sources will just be added together, giving you more use out of your Resistances. Resistances will be capped at 70% however, with certain ways allowing you to reach 85%. A note on Armor. Armor previously mitigated both Physical and Elemental damage. It will only resist Physical Damage now. We will be able to find All Resistance on Rings and Amulets. Other sources can come from gear, Paragon Boards, The Skill Tree, etc. With all these changes, Resistances in Season 2 and beyond will be a complex puzzle to solve, but not an impossible one. The Dev Team made sure that reaching cap, while not easy, is not only for the min/maxers. don't feel too exciting even if they have a good build tied to them. Most of the in the game have been updated this patch to ensure they are more desirable and useful. The Dev Team is using a new 4-fold strategy when it comes to fixing/making Uniques. Some examples of the changes they have made: Three examples of new coming in Season 2: Loot Tables for the new End Game Bosses coming in Season 2. Remember, they are a permanent part of the game: Many quality of life improvements are coming in Season 2. One general change is that Fortify will now be based on your Maximum Life now (formerly Base Life), allowing you to get more out of it. The team reiterated that during Season 1 they recognized the strength of certain stats/builds/mechanics. They are taking a new approach with Season 2 and beyond to make sure they bring overperforming items back in line. maximum damage bonus is being capped at 100% now. Critical Strike bonus is now capped at 200%. For the Necormancer, a predictable nerf to Ossified Essence is coming to bring it more inline with other Key Passives. The Legendary Node Essence per stack is also being reduced. The team felt Rogues were in a pretty good place. The one area they could identify that could use some improvement was in Basic Skills. is widely used and wanted to bring in line through buffs. There was also an update to improve the In Season 1, Overpower, Vulnerable and Crit Damage were separate buckets, meaning they would multiply together for a lot of damage. Making them the best stats to use across the game. This held back other stats and builds back. In Season 2, they will are still separate, but there is a cap to how much each can contribute. The many changes made for Season 2 are with this in mind to ensure that you will be able to do the same if not more damage, but no longer totally reliant on these stats to free up affix slots on gear. Ultimately, they want to bring underperforming builds up to the powerful builds, then balance monster power around that for a more strategic way of balancing the game. The team acknowledges that if they just did the Critical Strike Damage and Vulnerable stat changes, it could be seen as being a negative. That is why they felt they needed to update other areas of the game to make sure these changes are a net positive for the player. They do want to give players power scaling, but in different ways, so it doesn't breed the same outcome that exists in the game right now. This will still provide multiplicative power but linked to specific class mechanics/Paragon/etc. Coming out during Season 2, some time before BlizzCon (November 3rd/4th). A Training Dummy will be added in Kyovashad that will allow players to practice against different types of enemies. Also, A \"Reset All\" will be added for Paragon Boards. More additions and information are coming throughout Season 2. There are definitely skill that aren't performing compared to others. We want to take this as a case-by-case basis. We have learned a lot since release, but we don't mind if a particular skill fills a niche. It's something we are always looking at. No, channeling skills will not Overpower as it would breed a player behavior of \"fishing\" for Overpower procs. Stay tuned to BlizzCon. Always looking at bringing more for the future. No, the new End Game Bosses are just a way to target them - not the only way. From a design perspective, they made sure that the overall resistance caps would be achievable and not something you had to truly min/max to get to. They didn't want the update to be too burdensome, which these classes would excel at. The team doesn't expect too much of a class discrepancy come season release. The team hasn't fully resolved the typical Barbarian builds using all their shouts (or Sorcerers with their Defensive Skills). They are aware and want to look into them. Yes, with new Glyphs coming this season, they have more design space to do this. No, just from enemies to the player. With the absolute massive amount of changes coming to the game, you can rest assured that the will update any and all guides to make your Season 2 a successful one!

    "content": "In Season 1, Overpower, Vulnerable and Crit Damage were separate buckets, meaning they would multiply together for a lot of damage. Making them the best stats to use across the game. This held back other stats and builds back. In Season 2, they will are still separate, but there is a cap to how much each can contribute. The many changes made for Season 2 are with this in mind to ensure that you will be able to do the same if not more damage, but no longer totally reliant on these stats to free up affix slots on gear. Ultimately, they want to bring underperforming builds up to the powerful builds, then balance monster power around that for a more strategic way of balancing the game. The team acknowledges that if they just did the Critical Strike Damage and Vulnerable stat changes, it could be seen as being a negative. That is why they felt they needed to update other areas of the game to make sure these changes are a net positive for the player. They do want to give players power scaling, but in different ways, so it doesn't breed the same outcome that exists in the game right now. This will still provide multiplicative power but linked to specific class mechanics/Paragon/etc. Coming out during Season 2, some time before BlizzCon (November 3rd/4th). A Training Dummy will be added in Kyovashad that will allow players to practice against different types of enemies. Also, A \"Reset All\" will be added for Paragon Boards. More additions and information are coming throughout Season 2. There are definitely skill that aren't performing compared to others. We want to take this as a case-by-case basis. We have learned a lot since release, but we don't mind if a particular skill fills a niche. It's something we are always looking at. No, channeling skills will not Overpower as it would breed a player behavior of \"fishing\" for Overpower procs. Stay tuned to BlizzCon. Always looking at bringing more for the future. No, the new End Game Bosses are just a way to target them - not the only way. From a design perspective, they made sure that the overall resistance caps would be achievable and not something you had to truly min/max to get to. They didn't want the update to be too burdensome, which these classes would excel at. The team doesn't expect too much of a class discrepancy come season release. The team hasn't fully resolved the typical Barbarian builds using all their shouts (or Sorcerers with their Defensive Skills). They are aware and want to look into them. Yes, with new Glyphs coming this season, they have more design space to do this. No, just from enemies to the player.
