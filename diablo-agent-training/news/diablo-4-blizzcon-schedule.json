Read below for all the information for attendees and watchers alike! The fiery basin of the Burning Hells crackles and sparks in yearning—BlizzCon 2023 will soon be upon us! On in-person attendees can meet their favorite content creators, get a Hell’s Ink flash tattoo, receive a signature from members of the development team and more. For those tuning in from home, we’ll be broadcasting a special Diablo IV Campfire Chat live from the BlizzCon show floor and multiple Diablo-partnered content creators will be livestreaming, which can also be viewed in person by attendees. Here are many of the activities going on in the Diablo section of BlizzCon. Unless specified otherwise, these activities will be available on both Friday and Saturday of the event. Some of the most seasoned wanderers in our community will be at BlizzCon to share their secret to culling demons, but also, to meet you! Keep an eye out for meet-and-greet opportunities with these creators: Not only can you meet some prominent saviors of Sanctuary, but you can watch them paint the floor red with the viscera of felled demons live at BlizzCon. We’ll stream their exploits for those at home to watch as well. Take your love for Diablo to a more permanent level by getting 1 of 13 flash tattoo designs from the talented artists at Vatican Studios. Tattoos are complimentary for all BlizzCon attendees, but appointments will be on a first come first serve basis, so sign up early in person. For those who wish to display their devotion to the Burning Hells in a less permanent way, Prinker will be offering temporary versions of the Hell’s Ink flash tattoos. Appointments are not needed for this activity. Meet some of the makers of your favorite game during our developer signing opportunity. Members of our development team will be around every hour or so in a rotating cast to meet you. Place your fate in the hands of a professional Tarot Card reader. Will your future be as bright as the High Heavens or as frigid as the Fractured Peaks? There’s only one way to know… Appointments are not needed for this activity. “Kneel before him! And remember you are small, wonderfully small!” Place yourself between the animated wings of the father of Sanctuary, Inarius. This photo opportunity welcomes all to envision themselves as The Prophet. As they say in Sanctuary, it isn’t truly a celebration without a few sacrifices. Offer your mortality to the cultists for a once-in-a-lifetime photo opportunity. Peruse a collection of long-forgotten artifacts dredged up from the furthest reaches of Sanctuary in this walkthrough exhibit. Stay awhile and browse our selection of tomes and curios. This is where attendees can purchase special Diablo merch and literature and then have it signed by dutiful scribes. Quench your thirst for annihilating Lilith’s legions by partaking in a Mountain Dew scavenger hunt. Attendees will need to locate cans of Mountain Dew touched by Lilith’s hatred. Find all the cans and you’ll be entered into a giveaway for an especially sinister Lilith statue. Join game director Joe Shely, associate game director Brent Gibson, production director Tiffany Wat, lead game producer Kayleigh Calder, and associate director of community Adam Fletcher live from BlizzCon as they talk about what’s next for Diablo IV. This Campfire Chat will also be streamed for those at home to tune in. On the first day of BlizzCon, attendees will be able to drop questions into a box located in the Diablo section of BlizzCon—we’ll answer questions submitted to the box and sent to us via social media during the Campfire Chat.
