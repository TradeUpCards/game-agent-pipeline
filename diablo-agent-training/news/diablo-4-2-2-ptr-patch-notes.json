In the meantime, you can also take a look at our full Campfire Chat Wrap-Up: You can also check the replay of the Campfire Chat livestream: Ahead of his return, Belial’s putrid brand of deception flows freely through Sanctuary, tainting the mind and body of its worried populace. As Belial blurs the line between reality and fiction, his influence grows. Will deceiving all of Sanctuary sate the Lord of Lies’ seemingly bottomless appetite for power? The 2.2.0 Public Test Realm (PTR) for Diablo IV will be available from , offering you the chance to test upcoming changes and features releasing with the next season for the base game, along with some Vessel of Hatred updates. The purpose of the PTR is to test updates and features before the launch of the next season, Belial’s Return, where we’ll be focusing on bosses. Then, using your feedback, we’ll make some adjustments before our next season goes live. The feedback we receive helps us to fine-tune balance changes, eliminate bugs, and create the best experience possible while testing new systems. Thank you kindly for playing the PTR. Here is what the 2.2.0 PTR will be previewing ahead of the next season. Using illusory magic, you can now command the very power foes once manipulated to send your Wanderer to the dreaded “You Have Died” screen. Boss Powers are a new way to further deepen your builds using abilities siphoned from the carcasses of defeated World, Event, and Lair (formerly Endgame) Bosses. There are 24 Bosses across Sanctuary you can claim Boss Powers from. Each Boss Power has 2 effects—a Main and Modifier—that can be activated depending on the Power Slot you equip it to. You can have up to 1 Main and 3 Modifier Powers active at a time. Whichever Main Boss Power you equip will be the star of the show, the ability you feel most in your build. Whereas the Modifier Boss Powers are meant to bolster the Main Boss Power you selected, taking it to new heights. Tinker with different combinations of Main and Modifier powers to find the mix that best supports your build’s fantasy. Boss Powers can be acquired after killing targeted bosses across Sanctuary for the first time this season.
