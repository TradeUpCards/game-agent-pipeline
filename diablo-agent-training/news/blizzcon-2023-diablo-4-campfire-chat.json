These rings arrive on To enter the Abattoir, you need to complete the season journey and it's advised that you have a level 100 character with a strong build. This is a Seasonal endgame event only available to players within the Season of Blood. This event begins on , and ends on There are 25 tiers of difficulty, but the danger ramps up much more quickly than Nightmare dungeons. After you complete the Abattoir you obtain the powerful new Paragon Glyph! The level cap is 200, it gives a multiplicative damage bonus which scales off of Core attributes, and has a much larger radius than normal glyphs.

We've done some of this already with the Boss Ladder and we're looking for more. The team is also looking to add post Uber Lillith content. Yes, we want to cater to all types of players. There will be seasonal content, eternal content, vanilla content and expansion content. We don't have anything to announce in terms of when, but it's being talked about and is definitely coming in the future. We've seen a lot of players talking about this pain point, and felt it ourselves when playing. We want to make some improvements here. The social team wants to improve the tools available for players who want to communicate and interact. The goal is to get as many in place as possible before the expansion. We're not ready to share all of our plans for itemization going forward, but the team is working on the problems we see right now. It's too difficult to compare items, and we want to improve affixes by improving overly-conditional affixes. We want to add ways to modify items and add complexity to items such as a \"crafting\" system. We want to get aspects out of your inventory and into the Codex! This won't happen until after season 3 but the team is working on it. That's it for the BlizzCon 2023 Campfire Chat recap, but it looks like a storm of updates are rolling in over the next couple months.
