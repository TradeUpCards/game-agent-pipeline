The Mother's Blessing event is coming back! Overall effect of these changes and fixes is a small nerf to Luckily, that \"unless they die in one hit\" clause is doing a lot of heavy lifting, because this build is so strong that small enemies die in one hit in pretty much every situation except high tier Pit and 4-player Tier 8 Infernal Hordes. This nerf results in 3-4 tiers lower clears in The Pit and isn't really noticeable elsewhere (aside from slightly longer Councill fight). Overall, Lightnig Spear stays firmly in the S-tier as unquestioned strongest Sorcerer build and probably the strongest build across all classes. nerf seem to be implemented by adding a limit to how often the effect can be triggered. This limit is farily hard to reach but it's still there. In rare cases it can affect you even if your average Frozen Orb production is way below it, because it can prevent lucky back-to-back procs. In practical terms, this means that you should put more emphasis on increasing the impact of each Frozen Orb proc, rather than increasing the amount of procs you can get per second. Cooldown Reduction, Cooldown Reduction per Frozen Orb explosion, and Chance to cast Frozen Orb twice become slightly more important. Lucky Hit Chance and Chance to Launch a Frozen Orb on Lucky Hit become less important (RIP Adam Fletcher mentioned in a tweet Patch 1.5.1 notes should be released today! As usual, the will be there to cover all the updates and changes! The trading system has been disabled on August 14th to investigation some possible duplication issues. The trading is now back! The Gauntlet has been disabled on August 13th to address an issue that was identified. Now that it has been resolved, the Gauntlet is back: It has been revealed Diablo 4 Vessel of Hatred expansion will be discussed at Gamescom on August 21th! We will probably learn more about the expansion at this occasion. Worth noting, World of Wracraft: The War Within new expansion will also be a topic.
