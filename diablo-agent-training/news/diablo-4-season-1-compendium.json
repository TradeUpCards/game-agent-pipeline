    "content": "Diablo 4 Season 1 is upon us and we are excited to release a massive Season 1 Compendium containing a wave of updates to our content. We have several new Build Guides across all classes and have updated them all for Season 1 with Caged Heart recommendations. We'll be testing and learning a lot about the state of many classes alongside everyone else, and have a lot of updates planned throughout the Season. All Tier Lists have been updated and we've added a new Unique Item Tier List as well. We're working on building out a full Wiki section that can be found on our main navigation menu. Our search bar functions the same way, but now you can find any Aspect, Unique or Caged Heart to go along with our Side Quests, Dungeons and other Resources. So many things to talk about, let's dive in below and see everything we have to offer for Season 1! Can't decide which class to play on your own? Tier Lists are a great way to see how different builds and classes stack up against each other in various parts of the game. Choose your class and embark on an adventure. If you need assistance along the way, we have Leveling & Endgame guides to help you build a strong character. We'll be testing a lot of new builds and make sure our current guides stay relevant throughout the Season! With the new Season comes Season specific guides. Many of these will be expanded on once the Season goes live and we can see the full Battle Pass and Journey, etc. The Season brought with it a whole new set of Nightmare Dungeons, 32 Malignant Hearts,  6 new Unique Items and 7 new Legendary Aspects. We've also added a Wiki Section where you can search for any: Aspects, Dungeons, Caged Hearts, Side Quests & Unique Items! We've added Monster Families to our Dungeon filter page. You can now sort by each family to make target farming dungeons easier. Remember that you can also search this page by Aspect name to find the associated Dungeons as well! We hope you enjoy The Season of the Malignant with the aid of our updates. Our focus for the start of Season 1 is to get all our current Build Guides updated with the new while we navigate new builds that reveal themselves. We're continuing to work on more updates for ! More news coming this week stay tuned! If you haven't already, head over to our and select the D4 role in to stay up to date with our content development. Sanctuary here we come!
