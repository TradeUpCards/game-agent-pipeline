    "content": "We've published 4 new endgame build guides! Season 1 is approaching fast and we're constantly working on new guides and updates to existing ones. Many of our guides have had minor to major updates in the last week and will continue to do so as we get closer to Season 1 and finally get the patch notes! Let's check out the new guides from this week! Druid has exceptional clear thanks to very high range and area of effect. It also boasts great movement speed and solid defenses. At the late endgame it can be played without a Spirit Generator for a fast and smooth experience. The build is capable of high pushes but may be somewhat limited on the top end due to inconsistent Single Target Damage. The Support Druid is our first dedicated support guide for Diablo 4! This build is overflowing with defensive and utility options for group play, as well as a handful of offensive choices that aren't to be overlooked. Though the buff management and gear requirements may take some time to navigate, the payoff is well worth it. This build is fully capable of enabling its party to clear the most difficult endgame content, including Tier 100 and the Echoes of Lilith encounter! The Blight Corpse Explosion Necromancer offers a unique and powerful playstyle. Aka the \"Black Hole\" or \"Brawler\" Necromancer, this melee range Necromancer build relies on the combination of to quickly stack and deal an incredible amount of AoE DoT Shadow Damage and Critical Strike burst! It destroys high density and single targets alike, does not require a single , and only requires a few to function. It can consistently farm up to Tier 75, scaling well into the endgame. combines the devastating power of over Time (DoTs), with the unrelenting swarm of Undead Minions, that shows what it truly means to be a master of Life and Death! The combination of DOT and high Critical Strike/Vulnerable damage output means we consistently push through content. Learning how Minions interact with your different stats and buffs is the key to your success! We'll be doing a lot of updates and new builds over the next few weeks as we wait for Season 1 to arrive. We recently released our and have more quality of life updates for planned! More news coming this week stay tuned! If you haven't already, head over to our and select the D4 role in to stay up to date with our content development. Sanctuary here we come! Written by: Contributions by:"
