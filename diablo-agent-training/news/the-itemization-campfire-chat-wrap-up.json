    "content": "The Itemization Campfire Chat Livestream just took place. The panel consisted of (Game Director) (Associate Game Director), (Lead Class Designer), (Associate Game Designer) and (Director of Community). The topics included the massive Itemization updates, Class changes, PTR news, and so much more! See all the major points below. A specific PTR forum will be added to the Diablo 4 site as well the team will monitor social media channels. The Dev Team started with three key principles: Trading is being updated in a big way. will become tradable in Season 4! There are two exceptions: Items gain Affixes from a smaller pool. This is meant to remove a lot of duplicate or conditional effects. The Dev Team is also improving the potency of many Affixes including \" \". Sacred items now only drop in World Tier 3 with Ancestral items in World Tier 4. Overall affix Values have been increased. The amount of Affixes (at least for ) is meant to give you a great base item to work on and add to. Again, this is meant to change the itemization in game to a journey. Stat rolls on gear have been simplified, items now roll the Core stat associated with your Class and the Affix. For example a Sorcerer Wand now rolls , it cannot roll There were mentions of new Affixes coming to the game that we haven't seen before. A short list of them are: Gems have had a balance pass to more align them to the new Itemization update. Conditional parts have been removed to make them simpler to understand and work into a build with greater effectiveness. Core stats have been added to them as well. Crafting progression has been slightly increased, with a little more power at the top end. They also sell for more gold. All Legendary Aspects can now be placed into the Codex of power! Additionally, Aspect Crystals are gone. When you hover over a item, there is a new icon to tell you if it will increase the Power in the Codex. by Salvaging it, you increase the Power, you no longer need to go to The Occultist. There are up to 16 breakpoints for all powers (some have less; think Umbral). If you are lucky enough to find a high value or maxed out Power, you'll have it forever (on Eternal characters) or the length of the season (on Seasonal characters)! The Dev Team did mention you won't find a maxed value power in World Tiers 1 or 2. However, once maxed, the power's icon in the list gains a golden boarder. There are more ways to filter (including a favorites tab) along with a search function to easily find what you need. A more powerful version of a normal Affix that rolls 150% of its normal amount. This is to make for a more exciting drop that is immediately obvious. These only appear on dropped Ancestral in World Tier 4. However, they can appear on when you craft them. You can NOT enchant into a Greater Affix, and if you reroll a Greater Affix, you lose it. Tempering allows you to add new Affixes to your items. This is a new way to add truly different modifiers. Tempering is done through Temper Manuals. Temper Manuals can be generic, such as a few recipes to add a Mobility Affix, add a specific Weapon only Affix or Class specific Affix. Temper Manuals are NOT consumed when used, you have them forever. There are 6 categories to chose from when selecting Temper Manuals: You can only have 1 Temperd Affix from one catergory on an item at a time. At the Blacksmith, you place a item into the UI and select a valid Temper Manual. You'll have 5 attempts to see if you get the right Affix from the Manual. It's a random chance, but you can get lucky. Sacred Legendaries can have 1 Tempered Affix while Ancestral Legendaries can have 2. You can NOT Temper This is a new late game crafting system to increase the Affix values of your gear over 12 individual upgrades. At ranks 4, 8 and 12 a larger bonus is applied to one Affix (which can includes Tempered Affixes) at random. These three larger bonuses can hit three separate Affixes, a single Affix twice and another once, or if you are lucky a single Affix all three times! If you have gone through the Masterworking process with an item and don't like your outcome, you can reset the item (at a cost) and work through it again for a hopefully better outcome. Masterworking applies to Masterworking along with Tempering do replace the current Armor/Weapon upgrading process in game now. Many changes were discussed due to all the system updates coming to the game in Season 4. There is a high volume of meaningful changes coming to classes with this update. Also making flat damage powers more viable. Lastly, opening up the design space for more playstyles and options. What you see here is but the tip of the iceberg! Stay tuned for the PTR and Patch Notes. Many different game systems are receiving large overhauls. The Dev Team recognizes that the game is about what you do in the endgame, and with all the new systems coming in, they want to help you get there a little faster. With that, the following XP rate adjustments are coming in Season 4: She has the same drop table as and you can gain the materials to summon her from defeating A new experience crafted with feedback from the AoZ Event. You gain access to The Pit after completing a Nightmare Dungeon Tier 45 and obtain the quest. For the quest, you'll travel around the world to collect to open your first Pit level. You want to run The Pit to collect , which are used to summon much higher version of the ladder bosses. The first time you defeat one of these much tougher bosses, you'll receive a . While similar to the AoZ, there have been a few key changes: All current items will be flagged as legacy, so they won't be able to work with the new systems. They will continue to be used on your character. Masterworking increases the current value, so you can go beyond the max range. In Season 4, the camera is more zoomed out! It will be a selection in the settings. Team is excited to bring one to the game. It's something they all want to get done. All things being talked about, nothing to talk about now beyond what was shown. They still have the idea, but want to see where the current changes take us in scanning gear. Only drop rates will increase, not the rate of getting Greater Affixes, etc. Yes, you can group for The Pit Nothing for the game right now. There are a lot of core system changes, so handling that first is important right now. Powers in the Codex of Power are account wide, separated by Eternal vs Seasonal and Softcore vs. Hardcore. So, if your Seasonal Softcore character has a few powers unlocked, another Softcore character will have them, but not Hardcore or Eternal. is ready and will be blasting the Season 4 PTR to get all the key information for you.
