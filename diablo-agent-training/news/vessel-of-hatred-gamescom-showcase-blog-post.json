This endgame, cooperative dungeon rewards groups of players that can best the many perils that lay within. Venture through three individual wings to solve challenges, face deadly battles, and collaborate to emerge bloodthirsty to face the final boss.

Hiring a Mercenary selects them as your main companion, and when playing solo they will join your party to use their host of selected skills to aid you in combat. Reinforcements will emerge during combat to perform a skill to aid you in combat. Each Mercenary has abilities they can use to reinforce you by casting one of the skills you possess, or through a specific combat scenario. Setting this in-game action to trigger is called an Opportunity. For example, Reinforcements can have their Opportunity set to activate when you are hit by a Control Impairing Effect.

Deep in the heart of Nahantu lies a twisted testament to the depths the First Khazra will go to achieve their ends. Within lies the ultimate co-op challenge, the first of its kind in Diablo IV. This endgame, cooperative dungeon rewards groups of players that can best the many perils that lay within.

    "heading": "Patch 1.5.1, Vessel of Hatred... What's next?",
    "content": ", Raheir will be available to use in combat. Each of these fighters has their own quirks and accompanying qualities to help you in battle. Their abilities are made up of a variety of choices, with a broad mix of utility and damage-based skills to customize how these allies complement your given playstyle. can offer their support by joining your Party, by Hiring them when playing solo, or by selecting them to add key Reinforcements in times of need. You have the choice to select one of your unlocked as your hired hand. Hiring a Mercenary selects them as your main companion, and when playing solo they will join your party to use their host of selected skills to aid you in combat. Reinforcements will emerge during combat to perform a skill to aid you in combat. Each Mercenary has abilities they can use to reinforce you by casting one of the skills you possess, or through a specific combat scenario. Setting this in-game action to trigger is called an Opportunity. For example, Reinforcements can have their Opportunity set to activate when you are hit by a Control Impairing Effect. Note that you will need to have a different Hired Mercenary than the one who is currently your Reinforcement. Once you have unlocked another Mercenary outside of Raheir, you’ll be able to equip someone in both slots. Trust is most swiftly earned in the blood-strewn throes of battle. This trust with Mercenaries is known as Rapport. Rapport is what you’ll use to upgrade each Mercenary, earning skill points to unlock more of their abilities, caches, and increasing your ability to barter with each of your cohorts. Earn Rapport with different Mercenaries by using them as Reinforcements or Hired hands in battle. Mercenary-related events will appear through Sanctuary to earn great amounts of Rapport with your loyal companion. Each Mercenary has 10 Levels of Rapport to earn, and repeating the last level will earn you additional Pale Marks. These potent Coins are earned through Rapport, granting you the ability to purchase items from each Mercenary and used to refresh their wares available for trade. Pale Marks can be used for Bartering with each Mercenary to purchase coveted items from their inventory. Each Mercenary has a specific inventory for barter, which can be upgraded to offer a wide variety of Caches. Pale Marks can be used to broaden the items they’ll have available to barter, along with influencing which items may appear in their inventory next. Though each of these warriors deals in death, they carry their own specialty within The Den. Seek out their corresponding talents as Blacksmith, Occultist, Jeweler, and trusty Stash holder. Deep in the heart of Nahantu lies a twisted testament to the depths the First Khazra will go to achieve their ends. Within lies the ultimate co-op challenge, the first of its kind in Diablo IV. This endgame, cooperative dungeon rewards groups of players that can best the many perils that lay within. Venture through three individual wings to solve challenges, face deadly battles, and collaborate to emerge bloodthirsty to face the final boss. More than one wanderer has tried—and failed—to break this fortress. Only together with others can you expect to prevail over an evil that slowly grows stronger. The Dark Citadel is ruled by The First Khazra, who use the powers of the Citadel to perform wicked experiments on captured villagers, all in an attempt to resurrect an almighty demon by sacrificing souls. The Dark Citadel holds three separate Wings, each with their own secrets to unlock and demonic plans to unravel. Brute force will only let you venture so far; the cooperation of your allies is the key to besting each Wing before finally facing off against the final boss. Besting these complex bosses and intricate wings will require the efforts of your entire party. Each wing can be taken down as a group, and can be done in multiple visits if you require respite during this grand task. Communication with your allies will be key within the walls of the Citadel, and a new Marker System will be available to help indicate your next intended move. Every week you can earn a Weekly Rewards cache the first time the Dark Citadel is completed. These caches could grant you resplendent and exclusive items only offered from Dark Citadel. Throughout the Dark Citadel, you’ll earn Citadel Coins, which are key to unlocking cosmetics exclusive to Dark Citadel that evoke the regal mania of its demonic owners. The Dark Citadel becomes available once you reach the endgame. You’ll receive an introductory Quest to begin your journey, which only needs to be completed once on your Account. Mastering this challenge requires a minimum of two players, but it’s recommended to raise arms with a party of four for the best chance at emerging triumphant. The ideal way to approach this mighty challenge is to search far and wide for like-minded players… is here to help you find the right allies!

When releases, this new feature will be available to all Diablo IV players, allowing you to find just the kind of party you need. You can use to list or find a party for multiple activities within Sanctuary: from slaying through Nightmare Dungeons, selecting Wings to complete in the Dark Citadel, finding other players to share Materials to summon Endgame Bosses, to completing your Codex of Power.

Rapport is what you’ll use to upgrade each Mercenary, earning skill points to unlock more of their abilities, caches, and increasing your ability to barter with each of your cohorts. Earn Rapport with different Mercenaries by using them as Reinforcements or Hired hands in battle. Mercenary-related events will appear through Sanctuary to earn great amounts of Rapport with your loyal companion. Each Mercenary has 10 Levels of Rapport to earn, and repeating the last level will earn you additional Pale Marks. These potent Coins are earned through Rapport, granting you the ability to purchase items from each Mercenary and used to refresh their wares available for trade. Pale Marks can be used for Bartering with each Mercenary to purchase coveted items from their inventory. Each Mercenary has a specific inventory for barter, which can be upgraded to offer a wide variety of Caches. Pale Marks can be used to broaden the items they’ll have available to barter, along with influencing which items may appear in their inventory next. Though each of these warriors deals in death, they carry their own specialty within The Den. Seek out their corresponding talents as Blacksmith, Occultist, Jeweler, and trusty Stash holder. Deep in the heart of Nahantu lies a twisted testament to the depths the First Khazra will go to achieve their ends. Within lies the ultimate co-op challenge, the first of its kind in Diablo IV. This endgame, cooperative dungeon rewards groups of players that can best the many perils that lay within. Venture through three individual wings to solve challenges, face deadly battles, and collaborate to emerge bloodthirsty to face the final boss. More than one wanderer has tried—and failed—to break this fortress. Only together with others can you expect to prevail over an evil that slowly grows stronger. The Dark Citadel is ruled by The First Khazra, who use the powers of the Citadel to perform wicked experiments on captured villagers, all in an attempt to resurrect an almighty demon by sacrificing souls. The Dark Citadel holds three separate Wings, each with their own secrets to unlock and demonic plans to unravel. Brute force will only let you venture so far; the cooperation of your allies is the key to besting each Wing before finally facing off against the final boss. Besting these complex bosses and intricate wings will require the efforts of your entire party. Each wing can be taken down as a group, and can be done in multiple visits if you require respite during this grand task. Communication with your allies will be key within the walls of the Citadel, and a new Marker System will be available to help indicate your next intended move. Every week you can earn a Weekly Rewards cache the first time the Dark Citadel is completed. These caches could grant you resplendent and exclusive items only offered from Dark Citadel. Throughout the Dark Citadel, you’ll earn Citadel Coins, which are key to unlocking cosmetics exclusive to Dark Citadel that evoke the regal mania of its demonic owners. The Dark Citadel becomes available once you reach the endgame. You’ll receive an introductory Quest to begin your journey, which only needs to be completed once on your Account.

    "content": "Deep in the heart of Nahantu lies a twisted testament to the depths the First Khazra will go to achieve their ends. Within lies the ultimate co-op challenge, the first of its kind in Diablo IV. This endgame, cooperative dungeon rewards groups of players that can best the many perils that lay within. Venture through three individual wings to solve challenges, face deadly battles, and collaborate to emerge bloodthirsty to face the final boss. More than one wanderer has tried—and failed—to break this fortress. Only together with others can you expect to prevail over an evil that slowly grows stronger. The Dark Citadel is ruled by The First Khazra, who use the powers of the Citadel to perform wicked experiments on captured villagers, all in an attempt to resurrect an almighty demon by sacrificing souls. The Dark Citadel holds three separate Wings, each with their own secrets to unlock and demonic plans to unravel. Brute force will only let you venture so far; the cooperation of your allies is the key to besting each Wing before finally facing off against the final boss. Besting these complex bosses and intricate wings will require the efforts of your entire party. Each wing can be taken down as a group, and can be done in multiple visits if you require respite during this grand task. Communication with your allies will be key within the walls of the Citadel, and a new Marker System will be available to help indicate your next intended move. Every week you can earn a Weekly Rewards cache the first time the Dark Citadel is completed. These caches could grant you resplendent and exclusive items only offered from Dark Citadel. Throughout the Dark Citadel, you’ll earn Citadel Coins, which are key to unlocking cosmetics exclusive to Dark Citadel that evoke the regal mania of its demonic owners. The Dark Citadel becomes available once you reach the endgame. You’ll receive an introductory Quest to begin your journey, which only needs to be completed once on your Account. Mastering this challenge requires a minimum of two players, but it’s recommended to raise arms with a party of four for the best chance at emerging triumphant. The ideal way to approach this mighty challenge is to search far and wide for like-minded players… is here to help you find the right allies! This new feature is available across Diablo 4 when releases, allowing you to find wanderers of a similar mettle within Sanctuary. gives you the ability to list the type of party you’re looking for, set what game type or activity you’d like to run, where you’d like to play, and add preferences for both casual and completionist players alike.
