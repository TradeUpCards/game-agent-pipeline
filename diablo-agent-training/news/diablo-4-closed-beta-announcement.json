Keep in mind, the Closed Beta is open to those that have pre-purchased the game. The Open Beta will start a week later on March 24th and is playable for everyone! Regardless, you can play up to level 25 for as long as you want! Before the gates of Hell open, read up on our already released guides to hack and slash your way through the demons of the Closed Beta. We have written many guides from the previous Diablo 4 Press Preview. Reading them can give you a solid head start to make the best experience for this short Closed Beta period! Three classes (Barbarian, Rogue and Sorcerer) were available to test, and we've created an overview and unique class mechanic post for each one. Druid and Necromancer will certainly be coming when that information is available! One of the most important sections we create for any video game is how to get started, and we already have a plethora of beginner guides ready for Diablo 4. How the items and NPCs work are critical functions of Diablo 4. We have nine fresh guides for you to learn all about both of them: This is but a taste of what you can expect from with the Diablo 4 Closed Beta Announcement! From and so much more. We plan to cover every aspect of Diablo 4 at release to help you dominate the world of Sanctuary! will be blasting Diablo 4 and we hope to see you there!
