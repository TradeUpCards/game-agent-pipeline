    "content": "just took place. The panel consisted of (Associate Game Director), (Lead Class Designer), (Lead Live Game Designer), (Lead Seasons Designer), and (Associate Director of Community). The topics included PTR Learnings, class balancing, Season 4, and Q&A. See all the major points below. The Dev Team discussed general items, the PTR, and what has changed since then. There was a reiteration of the changes to items. items have only 2 affixes, have 3 affixes. Greater Affixes are a cool new addition that can give you 150% of the normal bonus to an affix. Also, lowering the quantity of affixes, but upping the quality of them on gear was a big step forward. They eased how some damage works, \"Damage on Tuesday,\" and simplified some requirements/conditions. Killing monsters at level 100 now guarantees Item Power 925 loot, reducing inventory sifting. Ultimately, it's about getting a good item and working on it. Not too much has changed since the PTR. Allowing players to skip the animations was added. Also, a stat range was added to the preview of the rolled affix to help make it clear how good of a roll it is. A lot of the system is unchanged. The skipping feature has been made better with the non-critical ranks being auto-skipped. There is no fail rate for the later ranks of Masterworking, however material costs are adjusted a little bit to compensate. Also, the conversion of materials with caches was stated to be made better from the PTR, with a long-term solution in the works post Season 4. The Pit was stated by the community to be a little too easy. Adjustments have been made to increase monster health to not always be one-shot. Also, Masterworking materials have been shifted into deeper tiers of when you receive them.

The Team brought up three major areas they took lessons from PTR. They received a lot of feedback at addressed each one for Season 4. With Armor being an infinite scaling stat (right now in Season 3) the team went back and capped the amount of Armor you need at Level 100. This is to give the player a goal to hit, a goal that is clear and not hidden, and most importantly not waste gear affix slots by going over the capped amount. Other affixes are getting caps too.

Season 4 shouldn't be impacted that much, at most it will be a week shorter. PTR only issue. Nope, it just resets the timer. Nope, just the player who used it.
