We've also added class tier lists, so you can compare build options for your class of choice. Take a look at our new and updated tier lists to get an idea of how your build stacks up for leveling, endgame, and speedfarming in the upcoming season. We are still in the process of updating our builds and releasing new guides for Season 6, as a result, you may get a 404 error when clicking links in our tier lists. Stay tuned over the next few days as we roll out the build guides and keep an eye out for our branch update post soon! We plan to have all of the build guides ready before Vessel of Hatred launches. You can use the new tier list filters at the top to access class-specific tier lists. Alternatively, if you want to see how builds perform across all classes, take a look at our new and updated tier lists! Click the images below to check out our new class tier lists.
