We've been tracking the Season 1 race on our and he's been leading the Solo Self Found pack for most of the race. Sadly yesterday at level 93 he has perished opening up the lane for rest of the Solo Players to race for glory. Since his death has reached level 100 on SSF bringing an end to the group and SSF races to 100. Congrats to everyone who raced to 100 already and good luck to those still pushing for it!
