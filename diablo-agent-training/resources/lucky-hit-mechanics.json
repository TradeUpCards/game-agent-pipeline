    "content": "The concept of Lucky Hit Mechanics is the most confusing and regularly misunderstood mechanic of Diablo 4. This guide aims to explain the core functionality of Lucky Hit to allow for more creativity when creating your builds on your own. To access all relevant in-game information, you must enable an in-game setting called Advanced Tooltip Information under Options > Gameplay > Advanced Tooltip Information. Additional information, such as Lucky Hit %, now appears while hovering over skills. Each time you damage an enemy, you have a chance to cause a Lucky Hit. Each skill has a different Lucky Hit Chance (also known as LHC), which you can find on the tooltip if the Advanced Tooltip option is enabled. But how does Lucky Hit Chance work? Let us look at the base functionality. as an example, it has a base chance of 25% to cause a Lucky Hit. This percentage will increase if we add any [+]% Lucky Hit to our gear. If we add [+]100% Lucky Hit Chance to our gear, we end up with Tooltip Lucky Hit %. This means that each time you damage a target with Dash, you have a 50% chance to Lucky hit. But what about skills like that already has a 100% chance to Lucky hit? It functions the same way, you take chance to Lucky hit. It may not sound intuitive, but Lucky Hit Chance above 100% still helps you, and here is why. The chance to trigger a Lucky Hit effect has two components, one being the tooltip Lucky Hit%, and the second being the chance to proc the effect itself. These two factors are not capped, so a factor higher than 100% Tooltip Lucky Hit% increases the probability that you will trigger a Lucky Hit effect. Assume that you have equipped and you play with Before Season 4, the game did not have enough [+]Lucky Hit Chance available for testing to be accurate enough for limit testing of Lucky Hit Chance functionality. However, with the changes to , more accurate testing could be done to gauge how frequently something procs reliably. On the PTR, effects such as had no internal cooldown and could occur without any cooldown. As of Season 6, could not trigger more frequently than roughly every ~0.7 sec regardless of the number of hits done (credits to DiEoxidE for playtesting on this). It is unclear which effects have an internal cooldown, but the following were tested and verified to not trigger twice within roughly ~0.7 seconds: Passives and aspects that trigger from a Lucky Hit are generally unable to generate Lucky Hits themselves. This is in place to prevent a chain of procs from occurring. However, there are some exceptions to this rule such as . It is unclear whether or not aspects or unique items are supposed to have a chance of causing a Lucky Hit, as it is not communicated in-game Direct damage implies that the skill has a single damage component and could be either a single target ability or area of effect (henceforth AoE). Let us use as an example for this section. has a 50% Base Skill Lucky Hit%, meaning that each time you use , you have a 50% chance to cause a Lucky Hit. If we wonder how many times on average that will trigger the Necromancer passive on average, we can calculate it using the formula from the previous section. Our tooltip Lucky Hit% is 50%, and our chance to trigger is 12%. We put these numbers into the formula and calculate that we have a chance to trigger . In other words, this functions the same way as the example we used in the General Functionality section. However, even Direct Damage can have complicated Lucky Hit functionality. Although has a 50% chance of causing a Lucky Hit, can Lucky Hit? The answer is yes, but their chance to Lucky Hit is not what you may think. and the formula is subject to change. \"Split Lucky Hit%\" is introduced as a concept whenever a skill includes a new damage source to a Direct Damage spell. For , we can plug our values into the formula to calculate the probability that a single bone shard will cause a Lucky Hit. This assumes that you create three bone shards per cast of has a 50% chance of causing a Lucky Hit. Each Bone Shard from chance of causing a Lucky Hit . If this was not complicated enough, this is further affected by deciding to use the upgrade. That means each time you cause a Critical Strike with , the formula for Lucky Hit of Bone Shard changes to include 5 Bone Shards instead. As such, adding more Bone Shards does not increase the overall probability. It, instead, reduces the LHC per Bone Shard to compensate for the additional Shards. This is because the Bone Shard formula includes the total amount of Bone Shards. Lucky Hit Chance for Damage over Time (henceforth DoT LHC) effects differs from Direct damage. The tooltip of a skill, such as , shows the probability of causing at least one Lucky Hit over its duration. See the end of the section for a list of all DoT effects with Lucky Hit. The following formula is used to calculate the probability of a DoT damage instance causing a Lucky Hit. as an example, you change \"duration\" to 5 and Tooltip Lucky Hit% to 33%. The reason why the duration is doubled is because DoT effects deal damage every 0.5 seconds. Furthermore, it is important to note that if we have , this affects the probability as we have Tooltip Lucky Hit% spread over more damage instances. Let us plug the values into the formula. , without any [+]% Lucky Hit, thus has a 3.9% chance of causing a Lucky Hit per damage instance when using the base duration. If you include duration increases, change the \"5\" in this calculation to the appropriate number. Because this formula has (100% - Tooltip LHC%) as a part of its calculation, it was theorized that you gain no more benefit from Lucky Hit once you reach 100% Tooltip Lucky Hit. Thanks to 's incredibly high [+]Lucky Hit Chance, we could finally investigate the behavior of the formula at 100% Tooltip Lucky Hit Chance. To disprove this theory, all that was required was to obtain 100% Tooltip Lucky Hit Chance for a pure DoT ability, such as , and observe its behavior. At [+]210% Lucky Hit, 100% Tooltip Lucky Hit was achieved, and the result was 58 procs of in 792 damage instances from . You can reverse engineer the rough Lucky Hit rate of this test by calculating the following: If the previous theory was correct, as (100% - Tooltip LHC%) approaches 0, the chance to trigger Lucky Hit effects skyrockets until finally getting to 100% Lucky Hit per tick. At 203.03% Lucky Hit, we would have had 99.99% Tooltip Lucky Hit and an expected proc total of X'fals triggers. This was not nearly the case, and similar tests were conducted at other Lucky Hit values to verify this functionality. Further testing has to be conducted, but based on this test, the following was true for When you overlap the DoT effects, the game does not communicate what happens with the Lucky Hit per tick. Does it remain the same? Does it increase? The answer is that it increases, but it has a cap. The only way to get an approximation for these caps is to pay a visit to your friendly Training Dummy and hit it for a very long time while counting Lucky Hit procs. Here are a few caps that have been identified: These caps only apply if the DoT is applied to the target. AoE skills differ as they are capped based on the amount you can maintain concurrently. For example, are both capped based on mana and Attack Speed. Meanwhile, a spell such as is AoE, but the damage is connected to the DoT and thus has a cap. Another specific case is , which only has a visual cap on how many can be active at a given time. What happens if different DoT effects overlap? That question is much easier to answer. When different DoT effects overlap, their DoT LHC% are all \"individually\" tracked but have their DoT LHC% added together. If we have one DoT effect with 20% DoT LHC%, one with 10%, and one with 23%, we can bunch them together as chance of causing a Lucky Hit. This is extremely powerful for builds that utilize damage sources such as Below is a complete list of abilities and aspects with a DoT LHC%. This list is subject to change depending on aspects introduced to the game and bug fixes for LHC%. Skills like have both a direct damage component and a damage over time component. These spells use the Split Lucky Hit% formula, but it also means that we have to do two calculations to determine the Lucky Hit Chance of the direct damage and the DoT. as our example, it has 40% Tooltip LHC%. We can plug that into the formula and get . Having done this, we immediately know that the direct damage of has a 22.54% chance of causing a Lucky Hit. To calculate the DoT LHC%, we plug in as our new Tooltip LHC% and 6 as our duration. The DoT LHC% for is 2.11% when you have 40% Tooltip LHC. So if we were wondering what the probability is for , we would have: The LHC is calculated with this method for every ability with a direct damage component and a DoT component. Some examples of these abilities are . However, there are some cases where the formula is altered slightly, such as for Instead of following the standard DoT LHC formula, the DoT LHC for first requires you to use the Split Lucky Hit% formula with a twist, in which it is changed to 1/3 at the end instead of 1/2. This means that instead of having a DoT LHC% of: , it has a DoT LHC% of: . This is not communicated in-game, and can only be found through testing. Reviewed by"

    "content": "The chance to trigger a Lucky Hit effect has two components, one being the tooltip Lucky Hit%, and the second being the chance to proc the effect itself. These two factors are not capped, so a factor higher than 100% Tooltip Lucky Hit% increases the probability that you will trigger a Lucky Hit effect. Assume that you have equipped and you play with Before Season 4, the game did not have enough [+]Lucky Hit Chance available for testing to be accurate enough for limit testing of Lucky Hit Chance functionality. However, with the changes to , more accurate testing could be done to gauge how frequently something procs reliably. On the PTR, effects such as had no internal cooldown and could occur without any cooldown. As of Season 6, could not trigger more frequently than roughly every ~0.7 sec regardless of the number of hits done (credits to DiEoxidE for playtesting on this). It is unclear which effects have an internal cooldown, but the following were tested and verified to not trigger twice within roughly ~0.7 seconds: Passives and aspects that trigger from a Lucky Hit are generally unable to generate Lucky Hits themselves. This is in place to prevent a chain of procs from occurring. However, there are some exceptions to this rule such as . It is unclear whether or not aspects or unique items are supposed to have a chance of causing a Lucky Hit, as it is not communicated in-game Direct damage implies that the skill has a single damage component and could be either a single target ability or area of effect (henceforth AoE). Let us use as an example for this section. has a 50% Base Skill Lucky Hit%, meaning that each time you use , you have a 50% chance to cause a Lucky Hit. If we wonder how many times on average that will trigger the Necromancer passive on average, we can calculate it using the formula from the previous section. Our tooltip Lucky Hit% is 50%, and our chance to trigger is 12%. We put these numbers into the formula and calculate that we have a chance to trigger . In other words, this functions the same way as the example we used in the General Functionality section. However, even Direct Damage can have complicated Lucky Hit functionality. Although has a 50% chance of causing a Lucky Hit, can Lucky Hit? The answer is yes, but their chance to Lucky Hit is not what you may think. and the formula is subject to change. \"Split Lucky Hit%\" is introduced as a concept whenever a skill includes a new damage source to a Direct Damage spell. For , we can plug our values into the formula to calculate the probability that a single bone shard will cause a Lucky Hit. This assumes that you create three bone shards per cast of has a 50% chance of causing a Lucky Hit. Each Bone Shard from chance of causing a Lucky Hit . If this was not complicated enough, this is further affected by deciding to use the upgrade. That means each time you cause a Critical Strike with , the formula for Lucky Hit of Bone Shard changes to include 5 Bone Shards instead. As such, adding more Bone Shards does not increase the overall probability. It, instead, reduces the LHC per Bone Shard to compensate for the additional Shards. This is because the Bone Shard formula includes the total amount of Bone Shards. Lucky Hit Chance for Damage over Time (henceforth DoT LHC) effects differs from Direct damage. The tooltip of a skill, such as , shows the probability of causing at least one Lucky Hit over its duration. See the end of the section for a list of all DoT effects with Lucky Hit. The following formula is used to calculate the probability of a DoT damage instance causing a Lucky Hit. as an example, you change \"duration\" to 5 and Tooltip Lucky Hit% to 33%. The reason why the duration is doubled is because DoT effects deal damage every 0.5 seconds. Furthermore, it is important to note that if we have , this affects the probability as we have Tooltip Lucky Hit% spread over more damage instances. Let us plug the values into the formula. , without any [+]% Lucky Hit, thus has a 3.9% chance of causing a Lucky Hit per damage instance when using the base duration. If you include duration increases, change the \"5\" in this calculation to the appropriate number. Because this formula has (100% - Tooltip LHC%) as a part of its calculation, it was theorized that you gain no more benefit from Lucky Hit once you reach 100% Tooltip Lucky Hit. Thanks to 's incredibly high [+]Lucky Hit Chance, we could finally investigate the behavior of the formula at 100% Tooltip Lucky Hit Chance. To disprove this theory, all that was required was to obtain 100% Tooltip Lucky Hit Chance for a pure DoT ability, such as , and observe its behavior. At [+]210% Lucky Hit, 100% Tooltip Lucky Hit was achieved, and the result was 58 procs of in 792 damage instances from . You can reverse engineer the rough Lucky Hit rate of this test by calculating the following: If the previous theory was correct, as (100% - Tooltip LHC%) approaches 0, the chance to trigger Lucky Hit effects skyrockets until finally getting to 100% Lucky Hit per tick. At 203.03% Lucky Hit, we would have had 99.99% Tooltip Lucky Hit and an expected proc total of X'fals triggers. This was not nearly the case, and similar tests were conducted at other Lucky Hit values to verify this functionality. Further testing has to be conducted, but based on this test, the following was true for When you overlap the DoT effects, the game does not communicate what happens with the Lucky Hit per tick. Does it remain the same? Does it increase? The answer is that it increases, but it has a cap. The only way to get an approximation for these caps is to pay a visit to your friendly Training Dummy and hit it for a very long time while counting Lucky Hit procs. Here are a few caps that have been identified: These caps only apply if the DoT is applied to the target. AoE skills differ as they are capped based on the amount you can maintain concurrently. For example, are both capped based on mana and Attack Speed. Meanwhile, a spell such as is AoE, but the damage is connected to the DoT and thus has a cap. Another specific case is , which only has a visual cap on how many can be active at a given time. What happens if different DoT effects overlap? That question is much easier to answer. When different DoT effects overlap, their DoT LHC% are all \"individually\" tracked but have their DoT LHC% added together. If we have one DoT effect with 20% DoT LHC%, one with 10%, and one with 23%, we can bunch them together as chance of causing a Lucky Hit. This is extremely powerful for builds that utilize damage sources such as Below is a complete list of abilities and aspects with a DoT LHC%.

It is unclear which effects have an internal cooldown, but the following were tested and verified to not trigger twice within roughly ~0.7 seconds: Passives and aspects that trigger from a Lucky Hit are generally unable to generate Lucky Hits themselves. This is in place to prevent a chain of procs from occurring. However, there are some exceptions to this rule such as . It is unclear whether or not aspects or unique items are supposed to have a chance of causing a Lucky Hit, as it is not communicated in-game Direct damage implies that the skill has a single damage component and could be either a single target ability or area of effect (henceforth AoE). Let us use as an example for this section. has a 50% Base Skill Lucky Hit%, meaning that each time you use , you have a 50% chance to cause a Lucky Hit. If we wonder how many times on average that will trigger the Necromancer passive on average, we can calculate it using the formula from the previous section. Our tooltip Lucky Hit% is 50%, and our chance to trigger is 12%. We put these numbers into the formula and calculate that we have a chance to trigger . In other words, this functions the same way as the example we used in the General Functionality section. However, even Direct Damage can have complicated Lucky Hit functionality. Although has a 50% chance of causing a Lucky Hit, can Lucky Hit? The answer is yes, but their chance to Lucky Hit is not what you may think. and the formula is subject to change. \"Split Lucky Hit%\" is introduced as a concept whenever a skill includes a new damage source to a Direct Damage spell. For , we can plug our values into the formula to calculate the probability that a single bone shard will cause a Lucky Hit. This assumes that you create three bone shards per cast of has a 50% chance of causing a Lucky Hit. Each Bone Shard from chance of causing a Lucky Hit . If this was not complicated enough, this is further affected by deciding to use the upgrade. That means each time you cause a Critical Strike with , the formula for Lucky Hit of Bone Shard changes to include 5 Bone Shards instead. As such, adding more Bone Shards does not increase the overall probability. It, instead, reduces the LHC per Bone Shard to compensate for the additional Shards. This is because the Bone Shard formula includes the total amount of Bone Shards. Lucky Hit Chance for Damage over Time (henceforth DoT LHC) effects differs from Direct damage. The tooltip of a skill, such as , shows the probability of causing at least one Lucky Hit over its duration. See the end of the section for a list of all DoT effects with Lucky Hit. The following formula is used to calculate the probability of a DoT damage instance causing a Lucky Hit. as an example, you change \"duration\" to 5 and Tooltip Lucky Hit% to 33%. The reason why the duration is doubled is because DoT effects deal damage every 0.5 seconds. Furthermore, it is important to note that if we have , this affects the probability as we have Tooltip Lucky Hit% spread over more damage instances. Let us plug the values into the formula. , without any [+]% Lucky Hit, thus has a 3.9% chance of causing a Lucky Hit per damage instance when using the base duration. If you include duration increases, change the \"5\" in this calculation to the appropriate number. Because this formula has (100% - Tooltip LHC%) as a part of its calculation, it was theorized that you gain no more benefit from Lucky Hit once you reach 100% Tooltip Lucky Hit. Thanks to 's incredibly high [+]Lucky Hit Chance, we could finally investigate the behavior of the formula at 100% Tooltip Lucky Hit Chance. To disprove this theory, all that was required was to obtain 100% Tooltip Lucky Hit Chance for a pure DoT ability, such as , and observe its behavior. At [+]210% Lucky Hit, 100% Tooltip Lucky Hit was achieved, and the result was 58 procs of in 792 damage instances from . You can reverse engineer the rough Lucky Hit rate of this test by calculating the following: If the previous theory was correct, as (100% - Tooltip LHC%) approaches 0, the chance to trigger Lucky Hit effects skyrockets until finally getting to 100% Lucky Hit per tick. At 203.03% Lucky Hit, we would have had 99.99% Tooltip Lucky Hit and an expected proc total of X'fals triggers. This was not nearly the case, and similar tests were conducted at other Lucky Hit values to verify this functionality. Further testing has to be conducted, but based on this test, the following was true for When you overlap the DoT effects, the game does not communicate what happens with the Lucky Hit per tick. Does it remain the same? Does it increase? The answer is that it increases, but it has a cap. The only way to get an approximation for these caps is to pay a visit to your friendly Training Dummy and hit it for a very long time while counting Lucky Hit procs. Here are a few caps that have been identified: These caps only apply if the DoT is applied to the target. AoE skills differ as they are capped based on the amount you can maintain concurrently. For example, are both capped based on mana and Attack Speed. Meanwhile, a spell such as is AoE, but the damage is connected to the DoT and thus has a cap. Another specific case is , which only has a visual cap on how many can be active at a given time. What happens if different DoT effects overlap? That question is much easier to answer. When different DoT effects overlap, their DoT LHC% are all \"individually\" tracked but have their DoT LHC% added together. If we have one DoT effect with 20% DoT LHC%, one with 10%, and one with 23%, we can bunch them together as chance of causing a Lucky Hit. This is extremely powerful for builds that utilize damage sources such as Below is a complete list of abilities and aspects with a DoT LHC%. This list is subject to change depending on aspects introduced to the game and bug fixes for LHC%. Skills like have both a direct damage component and a damage over time component. These spells use the Split Lucky Hit% formula, but it also means that we have to do two calculations to determine the Lucky Hit Chance of the direct damage and the DoT. as our example, it has 40% Tooltip LHC%. We can plug that into the formula and get . Having done this, we immediately know that the direct damage of has a 22.54% chance of causing a Lucky Hit. To calculate the DoT LHC%, we plug in as our new Tooltip LHC% and 6 as our duration. The DoT LHC% for is 2.11% when you have 40% Tooltip LHC. So if we were wondering what the probability is for , we would have: The LHC is calculated with this method for every ability with a direct damage component and a DoT component. Some examples of these abilities are . However, there are some cases where the formula is altered slightly, such as for Instead of following the standard DoT LHC formula, the DoT LHC for first requires you to use the Split Lucky Hit% formula with a twist, in which it is changed to 1/3 at the end instead of 1/2. This means that instead of having a DoT LHC% of: , it has a DoT LHC% of: . This is not communicated in-game, and can only be found through testing. Reviewed by"
