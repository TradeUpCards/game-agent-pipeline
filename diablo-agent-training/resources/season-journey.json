    "content": "The Season Journey is a series of challenges, called objectives, that offer rewards for players who choose to complete them. The challenges are broken up by Chapters, with substantial rewards for completing each of them.  Earlier Chapters consist of relatively easy challenges, while later they become substantially more difficult. Each Season has a different journey with unique challenges, so completing it is never the same! Your progress can be accessed through the Season Journey Window. Here you can see each chapter, objectives, and the rewards. We can also track the progress of individual objectives and entire chapters from here. To complete a Chapter you must finish a certain number of objectives. The number required to complete a Chapter is less than the number of Objectives offered for each chapter, so you have some flexibility in which ones you choose to target. Chapters can only be completed once per Season per account. Season Journeys can only be completed within the Season they are connected to. They cannot be completed within the Eternal Realm. Example: The Season Journey shown above is for Season 5 and can only be completed by a Seasonal character during Season 5. Once Season 6 starts, Season 5 will have ended and this Season Journey will no longer be accessible.
