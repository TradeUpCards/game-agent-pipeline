    "content": "The Rogue is one of the 6 classes available in Diablo 4. Learn all about their Strengths, Weaknesses, Skills, Items, and Tips & Tricks in our overview! The Rogue is a fast, agile fighter relying on a combination of melee and ranged attacks as well as various tricks up their sleeves, such as grenades and traps. They are fun to play with fast-paced action and many customization options. Their combat style can range from very methodical to lightning-fast zapping around the battlefield. Their skills are fueled by Energy, a resource that slowly recovers on its own or can be filled up quickly through various effects. Most skills deal damage by default but there are various mechanics also delving into damage types. The four core attributes provide the following to the Rogue: Dexterity is considered the main attribute as it multiplies all damage dealt. Strength and Intelligence are also useful for their offensive and defensive bonuses, while Willpower does not provide much value for most rogue builds. Some items can roll bonuses to attributes, and later on, Paragon boards allow stacking the right stats for your character. In addition, you may find hidden in the open world that unlock a permanent bonus for all of your characters. A Rogue's specialty is their ability to equip two one-handed melee weapons (Swords/Daggers) and a ranged weapon (Bow/Crossbow) at the same time and swap between depending on the ability used. Certain abilities require a specific weapon to be equipped, and unlike the Barbarians with their , you cannot choose which weapon to use for which ability. The stats of each weapon are always applied, meaning even with a full melee or full ranged build, you still benefit from equipping the other weapon types. Chest Armor Crossbow or Bow Sword and Dagger (x2) Skill points are unlocked by level-ups and the . As you spend more points, you unlock more and more categories of skills. Each active skill can be leveled up to 5 times or more with items, increasing their power (usually +10% of the base value) or reducing their cooldown by 5% with each additional rank. After unlocking a skill, you can enhance it with another point and then choose one out of two upgrades to specialize it further. In addition, there are passives found all over the tree, attached as optional choices to certain skill clusters. They grant small bonuses to damage, defense, or utility under certain conditions and help to round out your build by shifting it further in the direction you want to take. All passives have 3 ranks and usually scale linearly. The Rogue's are weak and mostly utility skills used to apply various debuffs, recover , or build Combo Points in most fights. However, when you run out of resources, they are useful to finish off small enemies or to add extra chip damage against an Elite while you prepare for a stronger attack later. This skill is particularly useful in later stages when near permanent Critical Strikes both apply a slow and recover Energy from various targets. Otherwise, it can be a consistent source of the Vulnerable debuff against single targets to boost DPS even early on. Note that this skill scales with your melee weapons despite attacking at range. This skill is great for ranged combat against one or two enemies, but only shines with a high Critical Strike Chance. The arrow seeks out enemies automatically and rarely misses even against moving targets. This skill is useful for ranged combat at all stages and a great source of Vulnerable against single targets. With constant knockbacks you are well protected against melee enemies. Hitting an enemy while below Energy makes them This skill helps a lot with keeping up Energy, especially in the early levels where regeneration is the only source of recovery. It also helps to apply Vulnerable on single targets. Other than that, it may be useful for its Lucky Hit Chance bonus for certain builds. This skill seems relatively weak on paper, but it attacks incredibly fast compared to other Basic Skills. It also adds lots of extra defense, which is useful for a melee playstyle. These skills are the bread and butter of most Rogue builds. They spend lots of but deal much higher damage and hit more targets than Basic skills. In addition, can be amplified by Combo Points generated with Basic Skills if the appropriate is chosen, allowing more tactical gameplay and better use of your resources. This is a great ranged , combining both pack clear with good single-target damage. The first arrow always fires exactly in front of you, and further arrows at an increasing angle, slightly towards the left and right in front of you, up to ~30°. Multiple arrows can hit the same enemy to increase single-target damage at close range. This is a more single-target oriented ranged skill. Multiple arrows can hit the same enemy to allow safe long-distance boss killing, but the skill struggles in dealing with big packs of enemies. This is a powerful pack-clearing skill with a high cost. With proper positioning you can mow through enemies quickly, then finish the remaining with another shot or skill. This skill is the primary melee Core skill. Simple to use and nearly spamable with some investment in Energy recovery. This skill hits 4 times for one quarter of its tooltip value per use, making it great combined with Imbuement skills and for lucky hit chance effects. This skill opens up an advanced, fast-paced way of playing Rogue. You need to hit the right target, then Evade, Dash, or Shadow Step in position for the returning blades to follow you through a pack. The returning blades home in on you from the original location with very high speed, but you can outrun them briefly to increase their distance covered and hit more enemies with a single attack. Difficult to use but incredibly fun once it all comes together. These skills move you around the battlefield, allowing quick repositioning or engaging of enemies. Almost every build should have at least one of these, with being a great universal skill for fast-paced Rogue action. This cluster of skills adds various utility choices to your setup. Generally, you want to choose one of these depending on your build and playstyle to assist you either offensively, defensively, or both. They massively add to the Rogue's class identity by giving you a little box of tricks to choose from. This skill is amazing for any build, especially ranged builds. The damage reduction is significant when you can avoid most small hits and keep the stack count high. This might not always be possible for melee builds where you constantly take chip damage, but it can still help against elites and bosses. Additionally, it allows faster travel with increased Movement Speed. This skill is extremely useful when fighting powerful or high level enemies. Even with little investment the Daze effect feels like an eternity. Against NPCs it works almost like a ranged stun on demand that also amplifies anyone's damage done to them. This skill is mostly useful for a full Trap-based playstyle combined with Caltrops and Exposure. The activation delay and long duration makes it difficult to get full value out of it, but if you do, it deals considerable damage and speeds up elite and boss kills significantly. In addition, it deals Poison damage, enabling further synergies with some passives and Poison Imbuement. This skill covers a lot of all-round utility. The whole package of faster movement, Energy recovery and a strong ambush attack makes it a great pick-up for almost any build, melee or ranged. Other players can still see you if they pay attention to their surroundings as you are not 100% transparent. These skills allow you to imbue your next two attacks with extra effects. Since they have a cooldown, they are effective for very methodical, slow-paced playstyles, for example revolving around Combo Points. Imbueable skills are all ultimate. Attacks that hit enemies multiple times, such as apply the imbuement effects on every hit without consuming additional charges, making them particularly effective. This skill almost single-handedly enables a whole DoT build archetype for the Rogue. Combined with damage over time effects and the Poison Trap that can reset Poison Imbuement's cooldown you watch enemies melt after a coordinated attack, balanced out by long cooldowns that might leave you without any tools to deal with remaining enemies that you didn't hit. This skill works best when paired with Flurry which hits 4 times per use, applying a stack each time to multiple enemies. This skill is great to enable some AoE clear for otherwise mostly single-target skills such as Barrage. You can apply the debuff to multiple enemies and then blow up a whole pack once the first small targets start dying, unleashing a chain reaction. This skill allows to add Crowd Control effects to any build, making combat safer and enabling extra damage modifiers. Ultimates are high-impact abilities with a long cooldown and need to be built around to be effective, so not every build runs with one of them. and multiple ranks can be put into it with a two-step linear upgrade path that offers no extra choices. This ultimate seems good but in practice performs very poorly due to lack of interaction with lots of endgame damage modifiers. The clone stays close to you and generally aims in the same direction towards enemies. This ultimate looks and feels amazing when used, allowing a huge burst that also crowd controls an entire room at once. While it deals a good amount of damage, it's not spectacular in light of its long cooldown and mostly a bonus and utility skill for dangerous fights. This ultimate is great for a Trap-based playstyle paired with lots of cooldown reduction effects and procs from the ultimate passive . On its own without synergistic effects it's not particularly noteworthy but it does allow for a great extra burst on demand. These passives are located at the very bottom of the Skill Tree and couldn't be reached in the preview version. They are extremely powerful and define the overall playstyle of your build. Similar to , only one of them can be chosen. For the Rogue, they greatly amplify existing core playstyles or open up the gate for completely new ones. Each time you attack with a Cutthroat skill, you gain stacks of . The effect of each stack is additive to each other and adds up to a large and potent multiplier for cutthroat-based builds. This passive is especially strong in the early game, but falls off a bit due to its lack of scalability. This passive requires at least one cutthroat and marksman-tagged skill. The passive provides an excellent attack speed steroid, and a damage buff that scales with your damage versus close targets stat. It is important to note that you only gain the damage buff while both stacks are active. This passive is tailored towards marksman skills only. Each time you attack with a Marksman-tagged skill, you gain a stack of Precision. After accumulating 3 charges, you spend them by using a Marksman Ultimate or Core skill. This causes the skill that consumes the charges to be a guaranteed Critical Strike and deal massively increased damage. This passive is effectively a copy of the , allowing massive AoE damage scaling with the only condition being the Vulnerable debuff on your target. This passive single-handedly enables a Trapper playstyle by allowing you to massively reduce the active cooldowns of very quickly. This passive enables an Imbuement-focused playstyle. Dealing non-physical damage with two elemental damage types increases the potency of all your imbuements. Potency means it increases the effectiveness of your imbuements, such as increased chill amount for Every class in Diablo 4 has a powerful and unique mechanic that contributes to its identity and the build-making process. For the Rogue, it's simply called , allowing you to choose one out of three passive bonuses that influence your playstyle. Your Specialization can be swapped at any time, even mid-combat. These three specializations are called are a mighty tool to enhance any . Especially in the slow-paced early game without many tools to recover effectively, make up a large portion of your attacks anyway. By using both types of skills in conjunction, you can build up to 3 Combo Points to unleash a more powerful with no extra cost. It also allows extra synergies for big nukes, for example by stacking 3 Combo Points before entering and attacking with a guaranteed Critical Strike. The Combo Point effects for each of the skills are: : Combo Points increase damage and raise arrows fired to : Combo Points increase damage and raise arrows fired to : Combo Points increase damage and increase Lucky Hit chance by : Combo Points increase damage and grant an Attack Speed bonus for 3 seconds. : Combo Points increase damage and grant a Movement Speed bonus for 3 seconds. helps you to keep high. As you approach a group of enemies, one of them will be marked with a above them at random. If the marked enemy survives for more than 10 seconds, the mark switches to another random nearby enemy. Hitting marked enemies fills up the Inner Sight gauge found next to your bar. Larger hits fill it up faster, meaning that a strong character benefits a lot more from this specialization. Likewise, this effect is rather weak in high-end content against very tanky enemies, as the gauge barely fills up. The permanent full bar is actually fake and simply an animated overlay on top of your globe. Behind the scenes your simply fills up once at the start of the effect and all your resource costs are set to 0 for the duration, but effects like can still drain your and leave you with nothing after it ends. allows you to reset the cooldown of your Ultimate Skill by spending . In addition, using your Ultimate Skill resets all other skills. This is a powerful tool for late game builds that have a lot of generation or run . With high Attack Speed, it is possible to use all of your skills much more often. Once you reach level 15, you automatically start the Priority Quest \"True Potential\". This short questline is required to unlock the Specialization feature. Maintained by"

A Rogue's specialty is their ability to equip two one-handed melee weapons (Swords/Daggers) and a ranged weapon (Bow/Crossbow) at the same time and swap between depending on the ability used. Certain abilities require a specific weapon to be equipped, and unlike the Barbarians with their , you cannot choose which weapon to use for which ability. The stats of each weapon are always applied, meaning even with a full melee or full ranged build, you still benefit from equipping the other weapon types. Chest Armor Crossbow or Bow Sword and Dagger (x2) Skill points are unlocked by level-ups and the . As you spend more points, you unlock more and more categories of skills. Each active skill can be leveled up to 5 times or more with items, increasing their power (usually +10% of the base value) or reducing their cooldown by 5% with each additional rank. After unlocking a skill, you can enhance it with another point and then choose one out of two upgrades to specialize it further. In addition, there are passives found all over the tree, attached as optional choices to certain skill clusters. They grant small bonuses to damage, defense, or utility under certain conditions and help to round out your build by shifting it further in the direction you want to take. All passives have 3 ranks and usually scale linearly. The Rogue's are weak and mostly utility skills used to apply various debuffs, recover , or build Combo Points in most fights. However, when you run out of resources, they are useful to finish off small enemies or to add extra chip damage against an Elite while you prepare for a stronger attack later. This skill is particularly useful in later stages when near permanent Critical Strikes both apply a slow and recover Energy from various targets. Otherwise, it can be a consistent source of the Vulnerable debuff against single targets to boost DPS even early on. Note that this skill scales with your melee weapons despite attacking at range. This skill is great for ranged combat against one or two enemies, but only shines with a high Critical Strike Chance. The arrow seeks out enemies automatically and rarely misses even against moving targets. This skill is useful for ranged combat at all stages and a great source of Vulnerable against single targets. With constant knockbacks you are well protected against melee enemies. Hitting an enemy while below Energy makes them This skill helps a lot with keeping up Energy, especially in the early levels where regeneration is the only source of recovery. It also helps to apply Vulnerable on single targets. Other than that, it may be useful for its Lucky Hit Chance bonus for certain builds. This skill seems relatively weak on paper, but it attacks incredibly fast compared to other Basic Skills. It also adds lots of extra defense, which is useful for a melee playstyle. These skills are the bread and butter of most Rogue builds. They spend lots of but deal much higher damage and hit more targets than Basic skills. In addition, can be amplified by Combo Points generated with Basic Skills if the appropriate is chosen, allowing more tactical gameplay and better use of your resources. This is a great ranged , combining both pack clear with good single-target damage. The first arrow always fires exactly in front of you, and further arrows at an increasing angle, slightly towards the left and right in front of you, up to ~30°. Multiple arrows can hit the same enemy to increase single-target damage at close range. This is a more single-target oriented ranged skill. Multiple arrows can hit the same enemy to allow safe long-distance boss killing, but the skill struggles in dealing with big packs of enemies. This is a powerful pack-clearing skill with a high cost. With proper positioning you can mow through enemies quickly, then finish the remaining with another shot or skill. This skill is the primary melee Core skill. Simple to use and nearly spamable with some investment in Energy recovery. This skill hits 4 times for one quarter of its tooltip value per use, making it great combined with Imbuement skills and for lucky hit chance effects. This skill opens up an advanced, fast-paced way of playing Rogue. You need to hit the right target, then Evade, Dash, or Shadow Step in position for the returning blades to follow you through a pack. The returning blades home in on you from the original location with very high speed, but you can outrun them briefly to increase their distance covered and hit more enemies with a single attack. Difficult to use but incredibly fun once it all comes together. These skills move you around the battlefield, allowing quick repositioning or engaging of enemies. Almost every build should have at least one of these, with being a great universal skill for fast-paced Rogue action. This cluster of skills adds various utility choices to your setup. Generally, you want to choose one of these depending on your build and playstyle to assist you either offensively, defensively, or both. They massively add to the Rogue's class identity by giving you a little box of tricks to choose from. This skill is amazing for any build, especially ranged builds. The damage reduction is significant when you can avoid most small hits and keep the stack count high. This might not always be possible for melee builds where you constantly take chip damage, but it can still help against elites and bosses. Additionally, it allows faster travel with increased Movement Speed. This skill is extremely useful when fighting powerful or high level enemies. Even with little investment the Daze effect feels like an eternity. Against NPCs it works almost like a ranged stun on demand that also amplifies anyone's damage done to them. This skill is mostly useful for a full Trap-based playstyle combined with Caltrops and Exposure. The activation delay and long duration makes it difficult to get full value out of it, but if you do, it deals considerable damage and speeds up elite and boss kills significantly. In addition, it deals Poison damage, enabling further synergies with some passives and Poison Imbuement. This skill covers a lot of all-round utility. The whole package of faster movement, Energy recovery and a strong ambush attack makes it a great pick-up for almost any build, melee or ranged. Other players can still see you if they pay attention to their surroundings as you are not 100% transparent. These skills allow you to imbue your next two attacks with extra effects. Since they have a cooldown, they are effective for very methodical, slow-paced playstyles, for example revolving around Combo Points. Imbueable skills are all ultimate.

Hitting an enemy while below Energy makes them This skill helps a lot with keeping up Energy, especially in the early levels where regeneration is the only source of recovery. It also helps to apply Vulnerable on single targets. Other than that, it may be useful for its Lucky Hit Chance bonus for certain builds. This skill seems relatively weak on paper, but it attacks incredibly fast compared to other Basic Skills. It also adds lots of extra defense, which is useful for a melee playstyle. These skills are the bread and butter of most Rogue builds. They spend lots of but deal much higher damage and hit more targets than Basic skills. In addition, can be amplified by Combo Points generated with Basic Skills if the appropriate is chosen, allowing more tactical gameplay and better use of your resources. This is a great ranged , combining both pack clear with good single-target damage. The first arrow always fires exactly in front of you, and further arrows at an increasing angle, slightly towards the left and right in front of you, up to ~30°. Multiple arrows can hit the same enemy to increase single-target damage at close range. This is a more single-target oriented ranged skill. Multiple arrows can hit the same enemy to allow safe long-distance boss killing, but the skill struggles in dealing with big packs of enemies. This is a powerful pack-clearing skill with a high cost. With proper positioning you can mow through enemies quickly, then finish the remaining with another shot or skill. This skill is the primary melee Core skill. Simple to use and nearly spamable with some investment in Energy recovery. This skill hits 4 times for one quarter of its tooltip value per use, making it great combined with Imbuement skills and for lucky hit chance effects. This skill opens up an advanced, fast-paced way of playing Rogue. You need to hit the right target, then Evade, Dash, or Shadow Step in position for the returning blades to follow you through a pack. The returning blades home in on you from the original location with very high speed, but you can outrun them briefly to increase their distance covered and hit more enemies with a single attack. Difficult to use but incredibly fun once it all comes together. These skills move you around the battlefield, allowing quick repositioning or engaging of enemies. Almost every build should have at least one of these, with being a great universal skill for fast-paced Rogue action. This cluster of skills adds various utility choices to your setup. Generally, you want to choose one of these depending on your build and playstyle to assist you either offensively, defensively, or both. They massively add to the Rogue's class identity by giving you a little box of tricks to choose from. This skill is amazing for any build, especially ranged builds. The damage reduction is significant when you can avoid most small hits and keep the stack count high. This might not always be possible for melee builds where you constantly take chip damage, but it can still help against elites and bosses. Additionally, it allows faster travel with increased Movement Speed. This skill is extremely useful when fighting powerful or high level enemies. Even with little investment the Daze effect feels like an eternity. Against NPCs it works almost like a ranged stun on demand that also amplifies anyone's damage done to them.

The activation delay and long duration makes it difficult to get full value out of it, but if you do, it deals considerable damage and speeds up elite and boss kills significantly. In addition, it deals Poison damage, enabling further synergies with some passives and Poison Imbuement. This skill covers a lot of all-round utility. The whole package of faster movement, Energy recovery and a strong ambush attack makes it a great pick-up for almost any build, melee or ranged. Other players can still see you if they pay attention to their surroundings as you are not 100% transparent. These skills allow you to imbue your next two attacks with extra effects. Since they have a cooldown, they are effective for very methodical, slow-paced playstyles, for example revolving around Combo Points. Imbueable skills are all ultimate. Attacks that hit enemies multiple times, such as apply the imbuement effects on every hit without consuming additional charges, making them particularly effective. This skill almost single-handedly enables a whole DoT build archetype for the Rogue. Combined with damage over time effects and the Poison Trap that can reset Poison Imbuement's cooldown you watch enemies melt after a coordinated attack, balanced out by long cooldowns that might leave you without any tools to deal with remaining enemies that you didn't hit. This skill works best when paired with Flurry which hits 4 times per use, applying a stack each time to multiple enemies. This skill is great to enable some AoE clear for otherwise mostly single-target skills such as Barrage. You can apply the debuff to multiple enemies and then blow up a whole pack once the first small targets start dying, unleashing a chain reaction. This skill allows to add Crowd Control effects to any build, making combat safer and enabling extra damage modifiers. Ultimates are high-impact abilities with a long cooldown and need to be built around to be effective, so not every build runs with one of them. and multiple ranks can be put into it with a two-step linear upgrade path that offers no extra choices. This ultimate seems good but in practice performs very poorly due to lack of interaction with lots of endgame damage modifiers. The clone stays close to you and generally aims in the same direction towards enemies. This ultimate looks and feels amazing when used, allowing a huge burst that also crowd controls an entire room at once. While it deals a good amount of damage, it's not spectacular in light of its long cooldown and mostly a bonus and utility skill for dangerous fights. This ultimate is great for a Trap-based playstyle paired with lots of cooldown reduction effects and procs from the ultimate passive .

This passive is especially strong in the early game, but falls off a bit due to its lack of scalability. This passive requires at least one cutthroat and marksman-tagged skill. The passive provides an excellent attack speed steroid, and a damage buff that scales with your damage versus close targets stat. It is important to note that you only gain the damage buff while both stacks are active. This passive is tailored towards marksman skills only. Each time you attack with a Marksman-tagged skill, you gain a stack of Precision. After accumulating 3 charges, you spend them by using a Marksman Ultimate or Core skill.

In addition, can be amplified by Combo Points generated with Basic Skills if the appropriate is chosen, allowing more tactical gameplay and better use of your resources. This is a great ranged , combining both pack clear with good single-target damage. The first arrow always fires exactly in front of you, and further arrows at an increasing angle, slightly towards the left and right in front of you, up to ~30°. Multiple arrows can hit the same enemy to increase single-target damage at close range. This is a more single-target oriented ranged skill. Multiple arrows can hit the same enemy to allow safe long-distance boss killing, but the skill struggles in dealing with big packs of enemies. This is a powerful pack-clearing skill with a high cost. With proper positioning you can mow through enemies quickly, then finish the remaining with another shot or skill. This skill is the primary melee Core skill. Simple to use and nearly spamable with some investment in Energy recovery. This skill hits 4 times for one quarter of its tooltip value per use, making it great combined with Imbuement skills and for lucky hit chance effects. This skill opens up an advanced, fast-paced way of playing Rogue. You need to hit the right target, then Evade, Dash, or Shadow Step in position for the returning blades to follow you through a pack. The returning blades home in on you from the original location with very high speed, but you can outrun them briefly to increase their distance covered and hit more enemies with a single attack. Difficult to use but incredibly fun once it all comes together. These skills move you around the battlefield, allowing quick repositioning or engaging of enemies. Almost every build should have at least one of these, with being a great universal skill for fast-paced Rogue action. This cluster of skills adds various utility choices to your setup. Generally, you want to choose one of these depending on your build and playstyle to assist you either offensively, defensively, or both. They massively add to the Rogue's class identity by giving you a little box of tricks to choose from. This skill is amazing for any build, especially ranged builds. The damage reduction is significant when you can avoid most small hits and keep the stack count high. This might not always be possible for melee builds where you constantly take chip damage, but it can still help against elites and bosses. Additionally, it allows faster travel with increased Movement Speed. This skill is extremely useful when fighting powerful or high level enemies. Even with little investment the Daze effect feels like an eternity. Against NPCs it works almost like a ranged stun on demand that also amplifies anyone's damage done to them. This skill is mostly useful for a full Trap-based playstyle combined with Caltrops and Exposure. The activation delay and long duration makes it difficult to get full value out of it, but if you do, it deals considerable damage and speeds up elite and boss kills significantly. In addition, it deals Poison damage, enabling further synergies with some passives and Poison Imbuement. This skill covers a lot of all-round utility. The whole package of faster movement, Energy recovery and a strong ambush attack makes it a great pick-up for almost any build, melee or ranged. Other players can still see you if they pay attention to their surroundings as you are not 100% transparent. These skills allow you to imbue your next two attacks with extra effects. Since they have a cooldown, they are effective for very methodical, slow-paced playstyles, for example revolving around Combo Points. Imbueable skills are all ultimate. Attacks that hit enemies multiple times, such as apply the imbuement effects on every hit without consuming additional charges, making them particularly effective. This skill almost single-handedly enables a whole DoT build archetype for the Rogue. Combined with damage over time effects and the Poison Trap that can reset Poison Imbuement's cooldown you watch enemies melt after a coordinated attack, balanced out by long cooldowns that might leave you without any tools to deal with remaining enemies that you didn't hit. This skill works best when paired with Flurry which hits 4 times per use, applying a stack each time to multiple enemies. This skill is great to enable some AoE clear for otherwise mostly single-target skills such as Barrage. You can apply the debuff to multiple enemies and then blow up a whole pack once the first small targets start dying, unleashing a chain reaction. This skill allows to add Crowd Control effects to any build, making combat safer and enabling extra damage modifiers. Ultimates are high-impact abilities with a long cooldown and need to be built around to be effective, so not every build runs with one of them. and multiple ranks can be put into it with a two-step linear upgrade path that offers no extra choices. This ultimate seems good but in practice performs very poorly due to lack of interaction with lots of endgame damage modifiers. The clone stays close to you and generally aims in the same direction towards enemies. This ultimate looks and feels amazing when used, allowing a huge burst that also crowd controls an entire room at once. While it deals a good amount of damage, it's not spectacular in light of its long cooldown and mostly a bonus and utility skill for dangerous fights. This ultimate is great for a Trap-based playstyle paired with lots of cooldown reduction effects and procs from the ultimate passive . On its own without synergistic effects it's not particularly noteworthy but it does allow for a great extra burst on demand. These passives are located at the very bottom of the Skill Tree and couldn't be reached in the preview version. They are extremely powerful and define the overall playstyle of your build. Similar to , only one of them can be chosen. For the Rogue, they greatly amplify existing core playstyles or open up the gate for completely new ones. Each time you attack with a Cutthroat skill, you gain stacks of . The effect of each stack is additive to each other and adds up to a large and potent multiplier for cutthroat-based builds. This passive is especially strong in the early game, but falls off a bit due to its lack of scalability. This passive requires at least one cutthroat and marksman-tagged skill. The passive provides an excellent attack speed steroid, and a damage buff that scales with your damage versus close targets stat. It is important to note that you only gain the damage buff while both stacks are active. This passive is tailored towards marksman skills only. Each time you attack with a Marksman-tagged skill, you gain a stack of Precision. After accumulating 3 charges, you spend them by using a Marksman Ultimate or Core skill. This causes the skill that consumes the charges to be a guaranteed Critical Strike and deal massively increased damage. This passive is effectively a copy of the , allowing massive AoE damage scaling with the only condition being the Vulnerable debuff on your target. This passive single-handedly enables a Trapper playstyle by allowing you to massively reduce the active cooldowns of very quickly. This passive enables an Imbuement-focused playstyle. Dealing non-physical damage with two elemental damage types increases the potency of all your imbuements. Potency means it increases the effectiveness of your imbuements, such as increased chill amount for Every class in Diablo 4 has a powerful and unique mechanic that contributes to its identity and the build-making process. For the Rogue, it's simply called , allowing you to choose one out of three passive bonuses that influence your playstyle. Your Specialization can be swapped at any time, even mid-combat. These three specializations are called are a mighty tool to enhance any . Especially in the slow-paced early game without many tools to recover effectively, make up a large portion of your attacks anyway. By using both types of skills in conjunction, you can build up to 3 Combo Points to unleash a more powerful with no extra cost. It also allows extra synergies for big nukes, for example by stacking 3 Combo Points before entering and attacking with a guaranteed Critical Strike.
