    "content": "The Alchemist allows you to create Potions, Elixirs, Incenses, and Crafting Materials for your character. Whether it's empowering your Healing Potion to help top off your Life pool, or crafting a powerful Elixir to increase your Attack Speed and gain, the Alchemist is your one-stop shop for min-maxing your potential with consumables. When your character reaches Level 10, you receive a Priority Quest objective to go and see the Alchemist in . Here you are given the task of upgrading your base Weak Healing Potion to a Tiny Healing Potion! At the low cost of 10 , your Healing Vial increases its efficiency by 6 additional From here you can see the level progression and materials required to further upgrade your Potion, and the other options the Alchemist has available. Once you have the Alchemist fully unlocked you can see the different consumables that can be crafted, including Elixirs and Incense. These two crafting options unlock at level 10 and level 50 respectively. As your character's level increases, you are able to increase the base granted on use by your Healing Potion. The cost to do so includes Gold as well as Resources found by picking flowers and completing side-quests. The cost and resource intensity are fairly linear all the way to Character Level 60. Upgrading the Healing Potion is an effective way to recover your at lower levels. However, when you reach the endgame in Diablo 4, the flat life you recover from the potion can be lacking compared to the health pool certain builds have when optimized. At that point, consider finding additional sources of recovery to sustain your life together with a fully upgraded potion. Elixirs are consumable items that give your Character specific buffs for a 30-minute duration. These can include different Resistances to increasing your Attack Speed. Common Elixir increases your Experience gain by 5% for the entire duration, while Elixirs increase your experience gain by 8%. Keeping a steady supply of Elixirs in your \"Consumables\" tab is a surefire way to blast through the leveling progression and min-max your Character for difficult content. You may only have one Elixir active at a time and they don't expire on Character death. The Alchemist allows you to take some of the hard fought over resources you have found and transmute them into others or items alike. This is a great boon to the player as you may have one of a particular material and can essentially convert it to your needs. Study what can be done to help you be as efficient as possible while playing. You can now use a new item called to skip the process of killing a boss that you do not need loot from to get the summoning materials needed to summon Duriel or Andariel. Normally, a boss requires 12 summoning materials to challenge, but Varshan is an outlier that costs 4 to summon. In other words, is inefficient to transmute this way as it requires more than double the materials to skip killing him compared to the material you get from the transmute. Meanwhile, the other material is more efficient to transmute if you do not need loot from them as it costs more to summon the boss than it does to transmute the materials. Incense applies a buff to all players within a decent-sized range around the user for 20 minutes. Players can only benefit from one of each buff at any given time. Incense grants an experience buff and persists through death. You can only use one Incense of each type (Defensive, Resistance, Core Stat) at a time. Maintained by"
