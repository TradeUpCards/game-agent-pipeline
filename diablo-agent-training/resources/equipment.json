The loot you grab from your adventures account for the majority of your character's overall power, kill speed, and survivability. Each gear slot can roll with specific stats with a thematic connection. Weapons increase your damage bonuses, Chest Armors increase your survivability, Boots increase your speed etc. Upgrading your gear is very important for min-maxing your . Eventually, you get that go even further to cement your build identity. For players who only care about looking super cool, collecting different items allows you to your kit to fit your style. Each Gear slot rolls from a certain pool of stats. This is overwhelming at first, but as you collect more equipment, the general themes of each item type start to come together. In addition to the generic affixes you can find on each slot, they also have unique stats that are important to prioritize. Armor Pieces (Helm, Chest, Gloves, Pants, Boots) generally grant you defensive and utility stats. These affixes can include +x Max Life, , +x to Skill Ranks, Resistances, and Movement Speed. For more details, check out our Jewelry Pieces (Ring, Amulet) grant you damage, utility, and resources. Additionally, they always grant you Resistances so you have a baseline of defense. Weapon Pieces (1-Handed, 2-Handed, Offhand) determine your Damage per Second. This stat directly affects your skill damage as well as the speed you're able to do many of your attacks. These gear pieces also give direct access to damage multipliers, such as Vulnerable Damage, Critical Strike Damage, and Damage Over Time. Check out for a deeper dive! You can also Socket and insert Gems into many of your gear-slots for added Stats. See our guide for more information! The item rarities in order are . They generally follow your character's level progression, with items dropping less often than items as you level up. items are incredibly rare, and are said to be some of the Best-in-Slot options you may never find in a Season. Additionally, there are some even rarer that can add even more power! items don't have additional affixes, while items generally only have a single affix. items begin with 2 affixes, while items have 3 affixes.

Item Power of equipment determines the range of the affixes that roll on your equipment & gear. As your Character level increases, the Item Power on gear you loot or receive from quests increases as well. The affixes on your gear have ranges that increase as Item Power increases. In addition to rolling higher item power, once you unlock Torment Difficulties, you unlock Ancestral items with 800 item power and a guaranteed Greater Affix. As you approach level 60 enemies, monsters always drop item power 750 loot. This means that after a certain point, you no longer have to worry about this attribute and only look for Ancestral As you acquire more and more gear, you may notice certain weapons and armor pieces having cooler aesthetics than others. For some people, looking cool is more important than getting an upgrade. If you want to keep the awesome look of an epic sword, but also want to upgrade to a better base, just go your old equipment & gear! Salvaging a piece of gear permanently captures its visual appearance for you to use in the Wardrobe to transmog your new gear. Transmogging your gear only changes the look of the gear piece. It does not transfer any of the item's stats or powers. While this may seem unimportant to some, no one likes putting down their cool early-level flaming sword from an epic quest reward, to use a strictly better, but lame-looking weapon. Maintained by"
