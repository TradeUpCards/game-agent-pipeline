This Barbarian Compendium aims to catalog all the known and discovered interactions, allowing you to make more educated decisions when building your character. Due to this being an ever-living document, it will be updated as soon as possible to reflect the most up-to-date information available in the community. A rule-of-thumb is that anything mentioned in this compendium has been tested and verified. If an interaction is not mentioned, assume that it has not been tested and catalogued. This section contains our Barbarian findings from the latest PTR cycle. Keep in mind any of these findings may be changed or be invalid when the next season starts.

The Weapon Expertise system grant various effects when you're different weapons for your skill casts. is in bold because it's key to kind of understand what the Weapon Expertise system works or doesn't work with. Let's start with how the Weapon Expertise system works. The basic idea is that when you cast a skill that can have weapons assigned to it, also called an Arsenal Selection (Dual Wield, Bludgeoning or Slicing), that skill gains a bonus depending on the Arsenal Selection that you've made, i.e you're a weapon when casting a skill. However if you're casting a skill that can not have a weapon selection assigned to it, you will not gain any additional effects for that skill cast because you're not a weapon for its cast. This difference can be seen with the tooltips below, where requires that an Arsenal Selection is assigned to it while does not have such a requirement. This means that if you cast while dual wielding 1-hand Maces, that cast will not gain 20% increased damage against enemies, while the cast will gain that bonus. Let's take a closer look at what the Weapon Expertise system does not work with. As mentioned above, any skill that does not have an Arsenal Selection will not gain any Weapon Expertise effects when it's cast, however there are a few more cases to be aware of: Let's talk through them. has several bugs associated with it being a new skill for Vessel of Hatred, and one of those bugs happens to be that it's not behaving properly with the Weapon Expertise system. Earthquakes and Dust Devils are weird because sometimes they are and sometimes they aren't considered a skill, and in this context spawning an Earthquake or a Dust Devil is considered casting a skill that can not have a weapon assigned to its cast, hence whenever one is spawned the game thought that you just used a skill without using a weapon for it, which means the entire Weapon Expertise system simply turns off. From testing we see that Weapon Expertise effects (in this case increased damage while ) disappear from the statsheet whenever a Lucky Hit direct damage proc from items occur. This means that the Weapon Expertise system sees these procs as casting a separate skill that deals damage without having a weapon assigned to it, and thus turns off when a damage proc happens. Do note that procs from does not show this behaviour, which is where the direct damage condition comes from. buff turning off Weapon Expertise effects is slightly baffling, however several tests have shown the effects turning off whenever the buff is gained/refreshed, meaning the Weapon Expertise system must see the buff as a separate skill cast that does not have an Arsenal Selection. Currently the Weapon Expertise effects behave differently depending on what weapon arsenal you're using for different damage types. The table below lists whether these Weapon Expertise effects: For example in the table we see that the increased damage against enemies has the following properties: with Direct hits simply means that even if does not gain any Weapon Expertise effects on its cast, you can swap to a Polearm immediately after casting and still gain the 15%[x] increased damage while effect for the pulses and even the initial hit if you have enough Attack Speed. We can also imagine the following example to show the One last thing to mention on the general Weapon Expertise topic. When you are wielding a weapon and also have that weapons bonus selected in the Technique slot, the first part of the Weapon Expertise effect (in this case 20%[x] increased damage against enemies with ) is added together with the bonus you get from simply using a weapon during and after a skill cast. So if you are wielding two 1-Handed Maces and also have that effect in the Technique slot you will deal 40%[x] increased damage against enemies when that effect is applicable. Same for goes e.g. - two instances of 10%[x] increased damage against enemies becomes 20%[x], and 15%[x] increased Lucky Hit with become 30%[x] increased Lucky Hit (note that this is a separate multiplier from Lucky Hit on gear). is part of the Weapon Expertise system that's available to Barbarians. It's made up of two parts: The technique part which is the same-ish effect as can be equipped at any time regardless of which weapon you're currently using, while the usage part which increases your damage after killing enemies only is active while you're using (holding in your hands) a 2-Handed Sword. The technique part is what's most commonly referred to when talking about , and we'll be doing the same going forward. Mechanically there's not much difference between , they both convert some percentage of the direct hits base damage to a on the target, however is limited to the following compared to Some notable examples to show this difference: The following interactions have been verified through damage recording or footage to ensure they are not functional.

The new Barbarian unique for Season 7 introduces a new mechanic, in the form of being able to detonate active Earthquakes for their total damage in one big hit by hitting them with a line that shoots out from your character when you use . Lets look at some of the affixes. . When an Earthquake is created the affix rolls a die, and if successful that Earthquake will deal double damage for all of its damage ticks and a subsequent explosion if detonated via the Unique effect. . The explosion damage is based off of the total damage an earthquake would deal over it's duration. So if we were to write out the damage an Earthquake would deal per tick it would look like: is from Earthquakes having a bug that makes them deal double damage compared to their tooltip values, and the represents the damage of 1 tick (4s duration with a tick every 0.5s). The total tick damage of an Earthquake and a detonation is simply written as: which is roughly the same amount when we account for the number of EQ ticks only going up by 1 every step of 12.5% duration, by comparison the explosion damage scales continously with more duration. Each Earthquake tick has a separate roll to cause a Critical Strike on each individual enemy hit, where as an Earthquake detonation just rolls a Critical Strike on each individual enemy hit as it's 1 instance of damage instead of several ticks. , if a multiplier snapshots to an Earthquake for its regular tick damage when that Earthquake is created, it will also be active for the detonation. See the for more information on Earthquake interactions.

The Weapon Expertise system grant various effects when you're different weapons for your skill casts. is in bold because it's key to kind of understand what the Weapon Expertise system works or doesn't work with. Let's start with how the Weapon Expertise system works. The basic idea is that when you cast a skill that can have weapons assigned to it, also called an Arsenal Selection (Dual Wield, Bludgeoning or Slicing), that skill gains a bonus depending on the Arsenal Selection that you've made, i.e you're a weapon when casting a skill. However if you're casting a skill that can not have a weapon selection assigned to it, you will not gain any additional effects for that skill cast because you're not a weapon for its cast. This difference can be seen with the tooltips below, where requires that an Arsenal Selection is assigned to it while does not have such a requirement. This means that if you cast while dual wielding 1-hand Maces, that cast will not gain 20% increased damage against enemies, while the cast will gain that bonus. Let's take a closer look at what the Weapon Expertise system does not work with. As mentioned above, any skill that does not have an Arsenal Selection will not gain any Weapon Expertise effects when it's cast, however there are a few more cases to be aware of: Let's talk through them. has several bugs associated with it being a new skill for Vessel of Hatred, and one of those bugs happens to be that it's not behaving properly with the Weapon Expertise system. Earthquakes and Dust Devils are weird because sometimes they are and sometimes they aren't considered a skill, and in this context spawning an Earthquake or a Dust Devil is considered casting a skill that can not have a weapon assigned to its cast, hence whenever one is spawned the game thought that you just used a skill without using a weapon for it, which means the entire Weapon Expertise system simply turns off. From testing we see that Weapon Expertise effects (in this case increased damage while ) disappear from the statsheet whenever a Lucky Hit direct damage proc from items occur. This means that the Weapon Expertise system sees these procs as casting a separate skill that deals damage without having a weapon assigned to it, and thus turns off when a damage proc happens. Do note that procs from does not show this behaviour, which is where the direct damage condition comes from. buff turning off Weapon Expertise effects is slightly baffling, however several tests have shown the effects turning off whenever the buff is gained/refreshed, meaning the Weapon Expertise system must see the buff as a separate skill cast that does not have an Arsenal Selection. Currently the Weapon Expertise effects behave differently depending on what weapon arsenal you're using for different damage types. The table below lists whether these Weapon Expertise effects: For example in the table we see that the increased damage against enemies has the following properties: with Direct hits simply means that even if does not gain any Weapon Expertise effects on its cast, you can swap to a Polearm immediately after casting and still gain the 15%[x] increased damage while effect for the pulses and even the initial hit if you have enough Attack Speed. We can also imagine the following example to show the One last thing to mention on the general Weapon Expertise topic. When you are wielding a weapon and also have that weapons bonus selected in the Technique slot, the first part of the Weapon Expertise effect (in this case 20%[x] increased damage against enemies with ) is added together with the bonus you get from simply using a weapon during and after a skill cast. So if you are wielding two 1-Handed Maces and also have that effect in the Technique slot you will deal 40%[x] increased damage against enemies when that effect is applicable. Same for goes e.g. - two instances of 10%[x] increased damage against enemies becomes 20%[x], and 15%[x] increased Lucky Hit with become 30%[x] increased Lucky Hit (note that this is a separate multiplier from Lucky Hit on gear). is part of the Weapon Expertise system that's available to Barbarians. It's made up of two parts: The technique part which is the same-ish effect as can be equipped at any time regardless of which weapon you're currently using, while the usage part which increases your damage after killing enemies only is active while you're using (holding in your hands) a 2-Handed Sword. The technique part is what's most commonly referred to when talking about , and we'll be doing the same going forward.

When an Earthquake is created the affix rolls a die, and if successful that Earthquake will deal double damage for all of its damage ticks and a subsequent explosion if detonated via the Unique effect. . The explosion damage is based off of the total damage an earthquake would deal over it's duration. So if we were to write out the damage an Earthquake would deal per tick it would look like: is from Earthquakes having a bug that makes them deal double damage compared to their tooltip values, and the represents the damage of 1 tick (4s duration with a tick every 0.5s). The total tick damage of an Earthquake and a detonation is simply written as: which is roughly the same amount when we account for the number of EQ ticks only going up by 1 every step of 12.5% duration, by comparison the explosion damage scales continously with more duration. Each Earthquake tick has a separate roll to cause a Critical Strike on each individual enemy hit, where as an Earthquake detonation just rolls a Critical Strike on each individual enemy hit as it's 1 instance of damage instead of several ticks. , if a multiplier snapshots to an Earthquake for its regular tick damage when that Earthquake is created, it will also be active for the detonation.

The Weapon Expertise system grant various effects when you're different weapons for your skill casts. is in bold because it's key to kind of understand what the Weapon Expertise system works or doesn't work with. Let's start with how the Weapon Expertise system works. The basic idea is that when you cast a skill that can have weapons assigned to it, also called an Arsenal Selection (Dual Wield, Bludgeoning or Slicing), that skill gains a bonus depending on the Arsenal Selection that you've made, i.e you're a weapon when casting a skill. However if you're casting a skill that can not have a weapon selection assigned to it, you will not gain any additional effects for that skill cast because you're not a weapon for its cast. This difference can be seen with the tooltips below, where requires that an Arsenal Selection is assigned to it while does not have such a requirement. This means that if you cast while dual wielding 1-hand Maces, that cast will not gain 20% increased damage against enemies, while the cast will gain that bonus. Let's take a closer look at what the Weapon Expertise system does not work with. As mentioned above, any skill that does not have an Arsenal Selection will not gain any Weapon Expertise effects when it's cast, however there are a few more cases to be aware of: Let's talk through them. has several bugs associated with it being a new skill for Vessel of Hatred, and one of those bugs happens to be that it's not behaving properly with the Weapon Expertise system. Earthquakes and Dust Devils are weird because sometimes they are and sometimes they aren't considered a skill, and in this context spawning an Earthquake or a Dust Devil is considered casting a skill that can not have a weapon assigned to its cast, hence whenever one is spawned the game thought that you just used a skill without using a weapon for it, which means the entire Weapon Expertise system simply turns off. From testing we see that Weapon Expertise effects (in this case increased damage while ) disappear from the statsheet whenever a Lucky Hit direct damage proc from items occur. This means that the Weapon Expertise system sees these procs as casting a separate skill that deals damage without having a weapon assigned to it, and thus turns off when a damage proc happens. Do note that procs from does not show this behaviour, which is where the direct damage condition comes from. buff turning off Weapon Expertise effects is slightly baffling, however several tests have shown the effects turning off whenever the buff is gained/refreshed, meaning the Weapon Expertise system must see the buff as a separate skill cast that does not have an Arsenal Selection. Currently the Weapon Expertise effects behave differently depending on what weapon arsenal you're using for different damage types. The table below lists whether these Weapon Expertise effects: For example in the table we see that the increased damage against enemies has the following properties: with Direct hits simply means that even if does not gain any Weapon Expertise effects on its cast, you can swap to a Polearm immediately after casting and still gain the 15%[x] increased damage while effect for the pulses and even the initial hit if you have enough Attack Speed. We can also imagine the following example to show the One last thing to mention on the general Weapon Expertise topic. When you are wielding a weapon and also have that weapons bonus selected in the Technique slot, the first part of the Weapon Expertise effect (in this case 20%[x] increased damage against enemies with ) is added together with the bonus you get from simply using a weapon during and after a skill cast. So if you are wielding two 1-Handed Maces and also have that effect in the Technique slot you will deal 40%[x] increased damage against enemies when that effect is applicable. Same for goes e.g. - two instances of 10%[x] increased damage against enemies becomes 20%[x], and 15%[x] increased Lucky Hit with become 30%[x] increased Lucky Hit (note that this is a separate multiplier from Lucky Hit on gear). is part of the Weapon Expertise system that's available to Barbarians. It's made up of two parts: The technique part which is the same-ish effect as can be equipped at any time regardless of which weapon you're currently using, while the usage part which increases your damage after killing enemies only is active while you're using (holding in your hands) a 2-Handed Sword. The technique part is what's most commonly referred to when talking about , and we'll be doing the same going forward. Mechanically there's not much difference between , they both convert some percentage of the direct hits base damage to a on the target, however is limited to the following compared to Some notable examples to show this difference: The following interactions have been verified through damage recording or footage to ensure they are not functional.

The new Barbarian unique for Season 7 introduces a new mechanic, in the form of being able to detonate active Earthquakes for their total damage in one big hit by hitting them with a line that shoots out from your character when you use . Lets look at some of the affixes. . When an Earthquake is created the affix rolls a die, and if successful that Earthquake will deal double damage for all of its damage ticks and a subsequent explosion if detonated via the Unique effect. . The explosion damage is based off of the total damage an earthquake would deal over it's duration. So if we were to write out the damage an Earthquake would deal per tick it would look like: is from Earthquakes having a bug that makes them deal double damage compared to their tooltip values, and the represents the damage of 1 tick (4s duration with a tick every 0.5s). The total tick damage of an Earthquake and a detonation is simply written as: which is roughly the same amount when we account for the number of EQ ticks only going up by 1 every step of 12.5% duration, by comparison the explosion damage scales continously with more duration. Each Earthquake tick has a separate roll to cause a Critical Strike on each individual enemy hit, where as an Earthquake detonation just rolls a Critical Strike on each individual enemy hit as it's 1 instance of damage instead of several ticks. , if a multiplier snapshots to an Earthquake for its regular tick damage when that Earthquake is created, it will also be active for the detonation.

The Weapon Expertise system grant various effects when you're different weapons for your skill casts. is in bold because it's key to kind of understand what the Weapon Expertise system works or doesn't work with. Let's start with how the Weapon Expertise system works. The basic idea is that when you cast a skill that can have weapons assigned to it, also called an Arsenal Selection (Dual Wield, Bludgeoning or Slicing), that skill gains a bonus depending on the Arsenal Selection that you've made, i.e you're a weapon when casting a skill. However if you're casting a skill that can not have a weapon selection assigned to it, you will not gain any additional effects for that skill cast because you're not a weapon for its cast. This difference can be seen with the tooltips below, where requires that an Arsenal Selection is assigned to it while does not have such a requirement. This means that if you cast while dual wielding 1-hand Maces, that cast will not gain 20% increased damage against enemies, while the cast will gain that bonus. Let's take a closer look at what the Weapon Expertise system does not work with. As mentioned above, any skill that does not have an Arsenal Selection will not gain any Weapon Expertise effects when it's cast, however there are a few more cases to be aware of: Let's talk through them. has several bugs associated with it being a new skill for Vessel of Hatred, and one of those bugs happens to be that it's not behaving properly with the Weapon Expertise system. Earthquakes and Dust Devils are weird because sometimes they are and sometimes they aren't considered a skill, and in this context spawning an Earthquake or a Dust Devil is considered casting a skill that can not have a weapon assigned to its cast, hence whenever one is spawned the game thought that you just used a skill without using a weapon for it, which means the entire Weapon Expertise system simply turns off. From testing we see that Weapon Expertise effects (in this case increased damage while ) disappear from the statsheet whenever a Lucky Hit direct damage proc from items occur. This means that the Weapon Expertise system sees these procs as casting a separate skill that deals damage without having a weapon assigned to it, and thus turns off when a damage proc happens. Do note that procs from does not show this behaviour, which is where the direct damage condition comes from. buff turning off Weapon Expertise effects is slightly baffling, however several tests have shown the effects turning off whenever the buff is gained/refreshed, meaning the Weapon Expertise system must see the buff as a separate skill cast that does not have an Arsenal Selection. Currently the Weapon Expertise effects behave differently depending on what weapon arsenal you're using for different damage types. The table below lists whether these Weapon Expertise effects: For example in the table we see that the increased damage against enemies has the following properties: with Direct hits simply means that even if does not gain any Weapon Expertise effects on its cast, you can swap to a Polearm immediately after casting and still gain the 15%[x] increased damage while effect for the pulses and even the initial hit if you have enough Attack Speed. We can also imagine the following example to show the One last thing to mention on the general Weapon Expertise topic. When you are wielding a weapon and also have that weapons bonus selected in the Technique slot, the first part of the Weapon Expertise effect (in this case 20%[x] increased damage against enemies with ) is added together with the bonus you get from simply using a weapon during and after a skill cast. So if you are wielding two 1-Handed Maces and also have that effect in the Technique slot you will deal 40%[x] increased damage against enemies when that effect is applicable. Same for goes e.g. - two instances of 10%[x] increased damage against enemies becomes 20%[x], and 15%[x] increased Lucky Hit with become 30%[x] increased Lucky Hit (note that this is a separate multiplier from Lucky Hit on gear). is part of the Weapon Expertise system that's available to Barbarians. It's made up of two parts: The technique part which is the same-ish effect as can be equipped at any time regardless of which weapon you're currently using, while the usage part which increases your damage after killing enemies only is active while you're using (holding in your hands) a 2-Handed Sword. The technique part is what's most commonly referred to when talking about , and we'll be doing the same going forward.

Lets look at some of the affixes. . When an Earthquake is created the affix rolls a die, and if successful that Earthquake will deal double damage for all of its damage ticks and a subsequent explosion if detonated via the Unique effect. . The explosion damage is based off of the total damage an earthquake would deal over it's duration. So if we were to write out the damage an Earthquake would deal per tick it would look like: is from Earthquakes having a bug that makes them deal double damage compared to their tooltip values, and the represents the damage of 1 tick (4s duration with a tick every 0.5s). The total tick damage of an Earthquake and a detonation is simply written as: which is roughly the same amount when we account for the number of EQ ticks only going up by 1 every step of 12.5% duration, by comparison the explosion damage scales continously with more duration. Each Earthquake tick has a separate roll to cause a Critical Strike on each individual enemy hit, where as an Earthquake detonation just rolls a Critical Strike on each individual enemy hit as it's 1 instance of damage instead of several ticks. , if a multiplier snapshots to an Earthquake for its regular tick damage when that Earthquake is created, it will also be active for the detonation.

The Weapon Expertise system grant various effects when you're different weapons for your skill casts. is in bold because it's key to kind of understand what the Weapon Expertise system works or doesn't work with. Let's start with how the Weapon Expertise system works. The basic idea is that when you cast a skill that can have weapons assigned to it, also called an Arsenal Selection (Dual Wield, Bludgeoning or Slicing), that skill gains a bonus depending on the Arsenal Selection that you've made, i.e you're a weapon when casting a skill. However if you're casting a skill that can not have a weapon selection assigned to it, you will not gain any additional effects for that skill cast because you're not a weapon for its cast. This difference can be seen with the tooltips below, where requires that an Arsenal Selection is assigned to it while does not have such a requirement. This means that if you cast while dual wielding 1-hand Maces, that cast will not gain 20% increased damage against enemies, while the cast will gain that bonus. Let's take a closer look at what the Weapon Expertise system does not work with. As mentioned above, any skill that does not have an Arsenal Selection will not gain any Weapon Expertise effects when it's cast, however there are a few more cases to be aware of: Let's talk through them. has several bugs associated with it being a new skill for Vessel of Hatred, and one of those bugs happens to be that it's not behaving properly with the Weapon Expertise system. Earthquakes and Dust Devils are weird because sometimes they are and sometimes they aren't considered a skill, and in this context spawning an Earthquake or a Dust Devil is considered casting a skill that can not have a weapon assigned to its cast, hence whenever one is spawned the game thought that you just used a skill without using a weapon for it, which means the entire Weapon Expertise system simply turns off. From testing we see that Weapon Expertise effects (in this case increased damage while ) disappear from the statsheet whenever a Lucky Hit direct damage proc from items occur. This means that the Weapon Expertise system sees these procs as casting a separate skill that deals damage without having a weapon assigned to it, and thus turns off when a damage proc happens. Do note that procs from does not show this behaviour, which is where the direct damage condition comes from. buff turning off Weapon Expertise effects is slightly baffling, however several tests have shown the effects turning off whenever the buff is gained/refreshed, meaning the Weapon Expertise system must see the buff as a separate skill cast that does not have an Arsenal Selection. Currently the Weapon Expertise effects behave differently depending on what weapon arsenal you're using for different damage types. The table below lists whether these Weapon Expertise effects: For example in the table we see that the increased damage against enemies has the following properties: with Direct hits simply means that even if does not gain any Weapon Expertise effects on its cast, you can swap to a Polearm immediately after casting and still gain the 15%[x] increased damage while effect for the pulses and even the initial hit if you have enough Attack Speed. We can also imagine the following example to show the One last thing to mention on the general Weapon Expertise topic. When you are wielding a weapon and also have that weapons bonus selected in the Technique slot, the first part of the Weapon Expertise effect (in this case 20%[x] increased damage against enemies with ) is added together with the bonus you get from simply using a weapon during and after a skill cast. So if you are wielding two 1-Handed Maces and also have that effect in the Technique slot you will deal 40%[x] increased damage against enemies when that effect is applicable. Same for goes e.g. - two instances of 10%[x] increased damage against enemies becomes 20%[x], and 15%[x] increased Lucky Hit with become 30%[x] increased Lucky Hit (note that this is a separate multiplier from Lucky Hit on gear). is part of the Weapon Expertise system that's available to Barbarians. It's made up of two parts: The technique part which is the same-ish effect as can be equipped at any time regardless of which weapon you're currently using, while the usage part which increases your damage after killing enemies only is active while you're using (holding in your hands) a 2-Handed Sword. The technique part is what's most commonly referred to when talking about , and we'll be doing the same going forward. Mechanically there's not much difference between , they both convert some percentage of the direct hits base damage to a on the target, however is limited to the following compared to Some notable examples to show this difference: The following interactions have been verified through damage recording or footage to ensure they are not functional.

The new Barbarian unique for Season 7 introduces a new mechanic, in the form of being able to detonate active Earthquakes for their total damage in one big hit by hitting them with a line that shoots out from your character when you use . Lets look at some of the affixes. . When an Earthquake is created the affix rolls a die, and if successful that Earthquake will deal double damage for all of its damage ticks and a subsequent explosion if detonated via the Unique effect. . The explosion damage is based off of the total damage an earthquake would deal over it's duration. So if we were to write out the damage an Earthquake would deal per tick it would look like: is from Earthquakes having a bug that makes them deal double damage compared to their tooltip values, and the represents the damage of 1 tick (4s duration with a tick every 0.5s). The total tick damage of an Earthquake and a detonation is simply written as: which is roughly the same amount when we account for the number of EQ ticks only going up by 1 every step of 12.5% duration, by comparison the explosion damage scales continously with more duration. Each Earthquake tick has a separate roll to cause a Critical Strike on each individual enemy hit, where as an Earthquake detonation just rolls a Critical Strike on each individual enemy hit as it's 1 instance of damage instead of several ticks. , if a multiplier snapshots to an Earthquake for its regular tick damage when that Earthquake is created, it will also be active for the detonation.

The Weapon Expertise system grant various effects when you're different weapons for your skill casts. is in bold because it's key to kind of understand what the Weapon Expertise system works or doesn't work with. Let's start with how the Weapon Expertise system works. The basic idea is that when you cast a skill that can have weapons assigned to it, also called an Arsenal Selection (Dual Wield, Bludgeoning or Slicing), that skill gains a bonus depending on the Arsenal Selection that you've made, i.e you're a weapon when casting a skill. However if you're casting a skill that can not have a weapon selection assigned to it, you will not gain any additional effects for that skill cast because you're not a weapon for its cast. This difference can be seen with the tooltips below, where requires that an Arsenal Selection is assigned to it while does not have such a requirement. This means that if you cast while dual wielding 1-hand Maces, that cast will not gain 20% increased damage against enemies, while the cast will gain that bonus. Let's take a closer look at what the Weapon Expertise system does not work with. As mentioned above, any skill that does not have an Arsenal Selection will not gain any Weapon Expertise effects when it's cast, however there are a few more cases to be aware of: Let's talk through them. has several bugs associated with it being a new skill for Vessel of Hatred, and one of those bugs happens to be that it's not behaving properly with the Weapon Expertise system. Earthquakes and Dust Devils are weird because sometimes they are and sometimes they aren't considered a skill, and in this context spawning an Earthquake or a Dust Devil is considered casting a skill that can not have a weapon assigned to its cast, hence whenever one is spawned the game thought that you just used a skill without using a weapon for it, which means the entire Weapon Expertise system simply turns off. From testing we see that Weapon Expertise effects (in this case increased damage while ) disappear from the statsheet whenever a Lucky Hit direct damage proc from items occur. This means that the Weapon Expertise system sees these procs as casting a separate skill that deals damage without having a weapon assigned to it, and thus turns off when a damage proc happens. Do note that procs from does not show this behaviour, which is where the direct damage condition comes from. buff turning off Weapon Expertise effects is slightly baffling, however several tests have shown the effects turning off whenever the buff is gained/refreshed, meaning the Weapon Expertise system must see the buff as a separate skill cast that does not have an Arsenal Selection. Currently the Weapon Expertise effects behave differently depending on what weapon arsenal you're using for different damage types. The table below lists whether these Weapon Expertise effects: For example in the table we see that the increased damage against enemies has the following properties: with Direct hits simply means that even if does not gain any Weapon Expertise effects on its cast, you can swap to a Polearm immediately after casting and still gain the 15%[x] increased damage while effect for the pulses and even the initial hit if you have enough Attack Speed. We can also imagine the following example to show the One last thing to mention on the general Weapon Expertise topic. When you are wielding a weapon and also have that weapons bonus selected in the Technique slot, the first part of the Weapon Expertise effect (in this case 20%[x] increased damage against enemies with ) is added together with the bonus you get from simply using a weapon during and after a skill cast. So if you are wielding two 1-Handed Maces and also have that effect in the Technique slot you will deal 40%[x] increased damage against enemies when that effect is applicable. Same for goes e.g. - two instances of 10%[x] increased damage against enemies becomes 20%[x], and 15%[x] increased Lucky Hit with become 30%[x] increased Lucky Hit (note that this is a separate multiplier from Lucky Hit on gear). is part of the Weapon Expertise system that's available to Barbarians. It's made up of two parts: The technique part which is the same-ish effect as can be equipped at any time regardless of which weapon you're currently using, while the usage part which increases your damage after killing enemies only is active while you're using (holding in your hands) a 2-Handed Sword. The technique part is what's most commonly referred to when talking about , and we'll be doing the same going forward. Mechanically there's not much difference between , they both convert some percentage of the direct hits base damage to a on the target, however is limited to the following compared to Some notable examples to show this difference: The following interactions have been verified through damage recording or footage to ensure they are not functional.

The new Barbarian unique for Season 7 introduces a new mechanic, in the form of being able to detonate active Earthquakes for their total damage in one big hit by hitting them with a line that shoots out from your character when you use . Lets look at some of the affixes. . When an Earthquake is created the affix rolls a die, and if successful that Earthquake will deal double damage for all of its damage ticks and a subsequent explosion if detonated via the Unique effect. . The explosion damage is based off of the total damage an earthquake would deal over it's duration. So if we were to write out the damage an Earthquake would deal per tick it would look like: is from Earthquakes having a bug that makes them deal double damage compared to their tooltip values, and the represents the damage of 1 tick (4s duration with a tick every 0.5s). The total tick damage of an Earthquake and a detonation is simply written as: which is roughly the same amount when we account for the number of EQ ticks only going up by 1 every step of 12.5% duration, by comparison the explosion damage scales continously with more duration. Each Earthquake tick has a separate roll to cause a Critical Strike on each individual enemy hit, where as an Earthquake detonation just rolls a Critical Strike on each individual enemy hit as it's 1 instance of damage instead of several ticks. , if a multiplier snapshots to an Earthquake for its regular tick damage when that Earthquake is created, it will also be active for the detonation.

The Weapon Expertise system grant various effects when you're different weapons for your skill casts. is in bold because it's key to kind of understand what the Weapon Expertise system works or doesn't work with. Let's start with how the Weapon Expertise system works. The basic idea is that when you cast a skill that can have weapons assigned to it, also called an Arsenal Selection (Dual Wield, Bludgeoning or Slicing), that skill gains a bonus depending on the Arsenal Selection that you've made, i.e you're a weapon when casting a skill. However if you're casting a skill that can not have a weapon selection assigned to it, you will not gain any additional effects for that skill cast because you're not a weapon for its cast. This difference can be seen with the tooltips below, where requires that an Arsenal Selection is assigned to it while does not have such a requirement. This means that if you cast while dual wielding 1-hand Maces, that cast will not gain 20% increased damage against enemies, while the cast will gain that bonus. Let's take a closer look at what the Weapon Expertise system does not work with. As mentioned above, any skill that does not have an Arsenal Selection will not gain any Weapon Expertise effects when it's cast, however there are a few more cases to be aware of: Let's talk through them. has several bugs associated with it being a new skill for Vessel of Hatred, and one of those bugs happens to be that it's not behaving properly with the Weapon Expertise system. Earthquakes and Dust Devils are weird because sometimes they are and sometimes they aren't considered a skill, and in this context spawning an Earthquake or a Dust Devil is considered casting a skill that can not have a weapon assigned to its cast, hence whenever one is spawned the game thought that you just used a skill without using a weapon for it, which means the entire Weapon Expertise system simply turns off. From testing we see that Weapon Expertise effects (in this case increased damage while ) disappear from the statsheet whenever a Lucky Hit direct damage proc from items occur. This means that the Weapon Expertise system sees these procs as casting a separate skill that deals damage without having a weapon assigned to it, and thus turns off when a damage proc happens. Do note that procs from does not show this behaviour, which is where the direct damage condition comes from. buff turning off Weapon Expertise effects is slightly baffling, however several tests have shown the effects turning off whenever the buff is gained/refreshed, meaning the Weapon Expertise system must see the buff as a separate skill cast that does not have an Arsenal Selection. Currently the Weapon Expertise effects behave differently depending on what weapon arsenal you're using for different damage types. The table below lists whether these Weapon Expertise effects: For example in the table we see that the increased damage against enemies has the following properties: with Direct hits simply means that even if does not gain any Weapon Expertise effects on its cast, you can swap to a Polearm immediately after casting and still gain the 15%[x] increased damage while effect for the pulses and even the initial hit if you have enough Attack Speed. We can also imagine the following example to show the One last thing to mention on the general Weapon Expertise topic. When you are wielding a weapon and also have that weapons bonus selected in the Technique slot, the first part of the Weapon Expertise effect (in this case 20%[x] increased damage against enemies with ) is added together with the bonus you get from simply using a weapon during and after a skill cast. So if you are wielding two 1-Handed Maces and also have that effect in the Technique slot you will deal 40%[x] increased damage against enemies when that effect is applicable. Same for goes e.g. - two instances of 10%[x] increased damage against enemies becomes 20%[x], and 15%[x] increased Lucky Hit with become 30%[x] increased Lucky Hit (note that this is a separate multiplier from Lucky Hit on gear). is part of the Weapon Expertise system that's available to Barbarians. It's made up of two parts: The technique part which is the same-ish effect as can be equipped at any time regardless of which weapon you're currently using, while the usage part which increases your damage after killing enemies only is active while you're using (holding in your hands) a 2-Handed Sword. The technique part is what's most commonly referred to when talking about , and we'll be doing the same going forward. Mechanically there's not much difference between , they both convert some percentage of the direct hits base damage to a on the target, however is limited to the following compared to Some notable examples to show this difference: The following interactions have been verified through damage recording or footage to ensure they are not functional.

The new Barbarian unique for Season 7 introduces a new mechanic, in the form of being able to detonate active Earthquakes for their total damage in one big hit by hitting them with a line that shoots out from your character when you use . Lets look at some of the affixes. . When an Earthquake is created the affix rolls a die, and if successful that Earthquake will deal double damage for all of its damage ticks and a subsequent explosion if detonated via the Unique effect. . The explosion damage is based off of the total damage an earthquake would deal over it's duration. So if we were to write out the damage an Earthquake would deal per tick it would look like: is from Earthquakes having a bug that makes them deal double damage compared to their tooltip values, and the represents the damage of 1 tick (4s duration with a tick every 0.5s). The total tick damage of an Earthquake and a detonation is simply written as: which is roughly the same amount when we account for the number of EQ ticks only going up by 1 every step of 12.5% duration, by comparison the explosion damage scales continously with more duration. Each Earthquake tick has a separate roll to cause a Critical Strike on each individual enemy hit, where as an Earthquake detonation just rolls a Critical Strike on each individual enemy hit as it's 1 instance of damage instead of several ticks. , if a multiplier snapshots to an Earthquake for its regular tick damage when that Earthquake is created, it will also be active for the detonation.

The technique part is what's most commonly referred to when talking about , and we'll be doing the same going forward.

The new Barbarian unique for Season 7 introduces a new mechanic, in the form of being able to detonate active Earthquakes for their total damage in one big hit by hitting them with a line that shoots out from your character when you use . Lets look at some of the affixes. . When an Earthquake is created the affix rolls a die, and if successful that Earthquake will deal double damage for all of its damage ticks and a subsequent explosion if detonated via the Unique effect. . The explosion damage is based off of the total damage an earthquake would deal over it's duration. So if we were to write out the damage an Earthquake would deal per tick it would look like: is from Earthquakes having a bug that makes them deal double damage compared to their tooltip values, and the represents the damage of 1 tick (4s duration with a tick every 0.5s). The total tick damage of an Earthquake and a detonation is simply written as: which is roughly the same amount when we account for the number of EQ ticks only going up by 1 every step of 12.5% duration, by comparison the explosion damage scales continously with more duration. Each Earthquake tick has a separate roll to cause a Critical Strike on each individual enemy hit, where as an Earthquake detonation just rolls a Critical Strike on each individual enemy hit as it's 1 instance of damage instead of several ticks. , if a multiplier snapshots to an Earthquake for its regular tick damage when that Earthquake is created, it will also be active for the detonation.

The Weapon Expertise system grant various effects when you're different weapons for your skill casts. is in bold because it's key to kind of understand what the Weapon Expertise system works or doesn't work with. Let's start with how the Weapon Expertise system works. The basic idea is that when you cast a skill that can have weapons assigned to it, also called an Arsenal Selection (Dual Wield, Bludgeoning or Slicing), that skill gains a bonus depending on the Arsenal Selection that you've made, i.e you're a weapon when casting a skill. However if you're casting a skill that can not have a weapon selection assigned to it, you will not gain any additional effects for that skill cast because you're not a weapon for its cast. This difference can be seen with the tooltips below, where requires that an Arsenal Selection is assigned to it while does not have such a requirement. This means that if you cast while dual wielding 1-hand Maces, that cast will not gain 20% increased damage against enemies, while the cast will gain that bonus. Let's take a closer look at what the Weapon Expertise system does not work with. As mentioned above, any skill that does not have an Arsenal Selection will not gain any Weapon Expertise effects when it's cast, however there are a few more cases to be aware of: Let's talk through them. has several bugs associated with it being a new skill for Vessel of Hatred, and one of those bugs happens to be that it's not behaving properly with the Weapon Expertise system. Earthquakes and Dust Devils are weird because sometimes they are and sometimes they aren't considered a skill, and in this context spawning an Earthquake or a Dust Devil is considered casting a skill that can not have a weapon assigned to its cast, hence whenever one is spawned the game thought that you just used a skill without using a weapon for it, which means the entire Weapon Expertise system simply turns off. From testing we see that Weapon Expertise effects (in this case increased damage while ) disappear from the statsheet whenever a Lucky Hit direct damage proc from items occur. This means that the Weapon Expertise system sees these procs as casting a separate skill that deals damage without having a weapon assigned to it, and thus turns off when a damage proc happens. Do note that procs from does not show this behaviour, which is where the direct damage condition comes from. buff turning off Weapon Expertise effects is slightly baffling, however several tests have shown the effects turning off whenever the buff is gained/refreshed, meaning the Weapon Expertise system must see the buff as a separate skill cast that does not have an Arsenal Selection. Currently the Weapon Expertise effects behave differently depending on what weapon arsenal you're using for different damage types. The table below lists whether these Weapon Expertise effects: For example in the table we see that the increased damage against enemies has the following properties: with Direct hits simply means that even if does not gain any Weapon Expertise effects on its cast, you can swap to a Polearm immediately after casting and still gain the 15%[x] increased damage while effect for the pulses and even the initial hit if you have enough Attack Speed. We can also imagine the following example to show the One last thing to mention on the general Weapon Expertise topic. When you are wielding a weapon and also have that weapons bonus selected in the Technique slot, the first part of the Weapon Expertise effect (in this case 20%[x] increased damage against enemies with ) is added together with the bonus you get from simply using a weapon during and after a skill cast. So if you are wielding two 1-Handed Maces and also have that effect in the Technique slot you will deal 40%[x] increased damage against enemies when that effect is applicable. Same for goes e.g. - two instances of 10%[x] increased damage against enemies becomes 20%[x], and 15%[x] increased Lucky Hit with become 30%[x] increased Lucky Hit (note that this is a separate multiplier from Lucky Hit on gear). is part of the Weapon Expertise system that's available to Barbarians. It's made up of two parts: The technique part which is the same-ish effect as can be equipped at any time regardless of which weapon you're currently using, while the usage part which increases your damage after killing enemies only is active while you're using (holding in your hands) a 2-Handed Sword. The technique part is what's most commonly referred to when talking about , and we'll be doing the same going forward. Mechanically there's not much difference between , they both convert some percentage of the direct hits base damage to a on the target, however is limited to the following compared to Some notable examples to show this difference: The following interactions have been verified through damage recording or footage to ensure they are not functional.

The new Barbarian unique for Season 7 introduces a new mechanic, in the form of being able to detonate active Earthquakes for their total damage in one big hit by hitting them with a line that shoots out from your character when you use . Lets look at some of the affixes. . When an Earthquake is created the affix rolls a die, and if successful that Earthquake will deal double damage for all of its damage ticks and a subsequent explosion if detonated via the Unique effect. . The explosion damage is based off of the total damage an earthquake would deal over it's duration. So if we were to write out the damage an Earthquake would deal per tick it would look like: is from Earthquakes having a bug that makes them deal double damage compared to their tooltip values, and the represents the damage of 1 tick (4s duration with a tick every 0.5s). The total tick damage of an Earthquake and a detonation is simply written as: which is roughly the same amount when we account for the number of EQ ticks only going up by 1 every step of 12.5% duration, by comparison the explosion damage scales continously with more duration. Each Earthquake tick has a separate roll to cause a Critical Strike on each individual enemy hit, where as an Earthquake detonation just rolls a Critical Strike on each individual enemy hit as it's 1 instance of damage instead of several ticks. , if a multiplier snapshots to an Earthquake for its regular tick damage when that Earthquake is created, it will also be active for the detonation.

The Weapon Expertise system grant various effects when you're different weapons for your skill casts. is in bold because it's key to kind of understand what the Weapon Expertise system works or doesn't work with. Let's start with how the Weapon Expertise system works. The basic idea is that when you cast a skill that can have weapons assigned to it, also called an Arsenal Selection (Dual Wield, Bludgeoning or Slicing), that skill gains a bonus depending on the Arsenal Selection that you've made, i.e you're a weapon when casting a skill. However if you're casting a skill that can not have a weapon selection assigned to it, you will not gain any additional effects for that skill cast because you're not a weapon for its cast. This difference can be seen with the tooltips below, where requires that an Arsenal Selection is assigned to it while does not have such a requirement. This means that if you cast while dual wielding 1-hand Maces, that cast will not gain 20% increased damage against enemies, while the cast will gain that bonus. Let's take a closer look at what the Weapon Expertise system does not work with. As mentioned above, any skill that does not have an Arsenal Selection will not gain any Weapon Expertise effects when it's cast, however there are a few more cases to be aware of: Let's talk through them. has several bugs associated with it being a new skill for Vessel of Hatred, and one of those bugs happens to be that it's not behaving properly with the Weapon Expertise system. Earthquakes and Dust Devils are weird because sometimes they are and sometimes they aren't considered a skill, and in this context spawning an Earthquake or a Dust Devil is considered casting a skill that can not have a weapon assigned to its cast, hence whenever one is spawned the game thought that you just used a skill without using a weapon for it, which means the entire Weapon Expertise system simply turns off. From testing we see that Weapon Expertise effects (in this case increased damage while ) disappear from the statsheet whenever a Lucky Hit direct damage proc from items occur. This means that the Weapon Expertise system sees these procs as casting a separate skill that deals damage without having a weapon assigned to it, and thus turns off when a damage proc happens. Do note that procs from does not show this behaviour, which is where the direct damage condition comes from. buff turning off Weapon Expertise effects is slightly baffling, however several tests have shown the effects turning off whenever the buff is gained/refreshed, meaning the Weapon Expertise system must see the buff as a separate skill cast that does not have an Arsenal Selection. Currently the Weapon Expertise effects behave differently depending on what weapon arsenal you're using for different damage types. The table below lists whether these Weapon Expertise effects: For example in the table we see that the increased damage against enemies has the following properties: with Direct hits simply means that even if does not gain any Weapon Expertise effects on its cast, you can swap to a Polearm immediately after casting and still gain the 15%[x] increased damage while effect for the pulses and even the initial hit if you have enough Attack Speed. We can also imagine the following example to show the One last thing to mention on the general Weapon Expertise topic. When you are wielding a weapon and also have that weapons bonus selected in the Technique slot, the first part of the Weapon Expertise effect (in this case 20%[x] increased damage against enemies with ) is added together with the bonus you get from simply using a weapon during and after a skill cast. So if you are wielding two 1-Handed Maces and also have that effect in the Technique slot you will deal 40%[x] increased damage against enemies when that effect is applicable. Same for goes e.g. - two instances of 10%[x] increased damage against enemies becomes 20%[x], and 15%[x] increased Lucky Hit with become 30%[x] increased Lucky Hit (note that this is a separate multiplier from Lucky Hit on gear). is part of the Weapon Expertise system that's available to Barbarians. It's made up of two parts: The technique part which is the same-ish effect as can be equipped at any time regardless of which weapon you're currently using, while the usage part which increases your damage after killing enemies only is active while you're using (holding in your hands) a 2-Handed Sword. The technique part is what's most commonly referred to when talking about , and we'll be doing the same going forward. Mechanically there's not much difference between , they both convert some percentage of the direct hits base damage to a on the target, however is limited to the following compared to Some notable examples to show this difference: The following interactions have been verified through damage recording or footage to ensure they are not functional.

The new Barbarian unique for Season 7 introduces a new mechanic, in the form of being able to detonate active Earthquakes for their total damage in one big hit by hitting them with a line that shoots out from your character when you use . Lets look at some of the affixes. . When an Earthquake is created the affix rolls a die, and if successful that Earthquake will deal double damage for all of its damage ticks and a subsequent explosion if detonated via the Unique effect. . The explosion damage is based off of the total damage an earthquake would deal over it's duration. So if we were to write out the damage an Earthquake would deal per tick it would look like: is from Earthquakes having a bug that makes them deal double damage compared to their tooltip values, and the represents the damage of 1 tick (4s duration with a tick every 0.5s). The total tick damage of an Earthquake and a detonation is simply written as: which is roughly the same amount when we account for the number of EQ ticks only going up by 1 every step of 12.5% duration, by comparison the explosion damage scales continously with more duration. Each Earthquake tick has a separate roll to cause a Critical Strike on each individual enemy hit, where as an Earthquake detonation just rolls a Critical Strike on each individual enemy hit as it's 1 instance of damage instead of several ticks. , if a multiplier snapshots to an Earthquake for its regular tick damage when that Earthquake is created, it will also be active for the detonation.

The Weapon Expertise system grant various effects when you're different weapons for your skill casts. is in bold because it's key to kind of understand what the Weapon Expertise system works or doesn't work with. Let's start with how the Weapon Expertise system works. The basic idea is that when you cast a skill that can have weapons assigned to it, also called an Arsenal Selection (Dual Wield, Bludgeoning or Slicing), that skill gains a bonus depending on the Arsenal Selection that you've made, i.e you're a weapon when casting a skill. However if you're casting a skill that can not have a weapon selection assigned to it, you will not gain any additional effects for that skill cast because you're not a weapon for its cast. This difference can be seen with the tooltips below, where requires that an Arsenal Selection is assigned to it while does not have such a requirement. This means that if you cast while dual wielding 1-hand Maces, that cast will not gain 20% increased damage against enemies, while the cast will gain that bonus. Let's take a closer look at what the Weapon Expertise system does not work with. As mentioned above, any skill that does not have an Arsenal Selection will not gain any Weapon Expertise effects when it's cast, however there are a few more cases to be aware of: Let's talk through them. has several bugs associated with it being a new skill for Vessel of Hatred, and one of those bugs happens to be that it's not behaving properly with the Weapon Expertise system. Earthquakes and Dust Devils are weird because sometimes they are and sometimes they aren't considered a skill, and in this context spawning an Earthquake or a Dust Devil is considered casting a skill that can not have a weapon assigned to its cast, hence whenever one is spawned the game thought that you just used a skill without using a weapon for it, which means the entire Weapon Expertise system simply turns off. From testing we see that Weapon Expertise effects (in this case increased damage while ) disappear from the statsheet whenever a Lucky Hit direct damage proc from items occur. This means that the Weapon Expertise system sees these procs as casting a separate skill that deals damage without having a weapon assigned to it, and thus turns off when a damage proc happens. Do note that procs from does not show this behaviour, which is where the direct damage condition comes from. buff turning off Weapon Expertise effects is slightly baffling, however several tests have shown the effects turning off whenever the buff is gained/refreshed, meaning the Weapon Expertise system must see the buff as a separate skill cast that does not have an Arsenal Selection. Currently the Weapon Expertise effects behave differently depending on what weapon arsenal you're using for different damage types. The table below lists whether these Weapon Expertise effects: For example in the table we see that the increased damage against enemies has the following properties: with Direct hits simply means that even if does not gain any Weapon Expertise effects on its cast, you can swap to a Polearm immediately after casting and still gain the 15%[x] increased damage while effect for the pulses and even the initial hit if you have enough Attack Speed. We can also imagine the following example to show the One last thing to mention on the general Weapon Expertise topic. When you are wielding a weapon and also have that weapons bonus selected in the Technique slot, the first part of the Weapon Expertise effect (in this case 20%[x] increased damage against enemies with ) is added together with the bonus you get from simply using a weapon during and after a skill cast. So if you are wielding two 1-Handed Maces and also have that effect in the Technique slot you will deal 40%[x] increased damage against enemies when that effect is applicable. Same for goes e.g. - two instances of 10%[x] increased damage against enemies becomes 20%[x], and 15%[x] increased Lucky Hit with become 30%[x] increased Lucky Hit (note that this is a separate multiplier from Lucky Hit on gear). is part of the Weapon Expertise system that's available to Barbarians. It's made up of two parts: The technique part which is the same-ish effect as can be equipped at any time regardless of which weapon you're currently using, while the usage part which increases your damage after killing enemies only is active while you're using (holding in your hands) a 2-Handed Sword. The technique part is what's most commonly referred to when talking about , and we'll be doing the same going forward. Mechanically there's not much difference between , they both convert some percentage of the direct hits base damage to a on the target, however is limited to the following compared to Some notable examples to show this difference: The following interactions have been verified through damage recording or footage to ensure they are not functional.

The new Barbarian unique for Season 7 introduces a new mechanic, in the form of being able to detonate active Earthquakes for their total damage in one big hit by hitting them with a line that shoots out from your character when you use . Lets look at some of the affixes. . When an Earthquake is created the affix rolls a die, and if successful that Earthquake will deal double damage for all of its damage ticks and a subsequent explosion if detonated via the Unique effect. . The explosion damage is based off of the total damage an earthquake would deal over it's duration. So if we were to write out the damage an Earthquake would deal per tick it would look like: is from Earthquakes having a bug that makes them deal double damage compared to their tooltip values, and the represents the damage of 1 tick (4s duration with a tick every 0.5s). The total tick damage of an Earthquake and a detonation is simply written as: which is roughly the same amount when we account for the number of EQ ticks only going up by 1 every step of 12.5% duration, by comparison the explosion damage scales continously with more duration. Each Earthquake tick has a separate roll to cause a Critical Strike on each individual enemy hit, where as an Earthquake detonation just rolls a Critical Strike on each individual enemy hit as it's 1 instance of damage instead of several ticks. , if a multiplier snapshots to an Earthquake for its regular tick damage when that Earthquake is created, it will also be active for the detonation.

The Weapon Expertise system grant various effects when you're different weapons for your skill casts. is in bold because it's key to kind of understand what the Weapon Expertise system works or doesn't work with. Let's start with how the Weapon Expertise system works. The basic idea is that when you cast a skill that can have weapons assigned to it, also called an Arsenal Selection (Dual Wield, Bludgeoning or Slicing), that skill gains a bonus depending on the Arsenal Selection that you've made, i.e you're a weapon when casting a skill. However if you're casting a skill that can not have a weapon selection assigned to it, you will not gain any additional effects for that skill cast because you're not a weapon for its cast. This difference can be seen with the tooltips below, where requires that an Arsenal Selection is assigned to it while does not have such a requirement. This means that if you cast while dual wielding 1-hand Maces, that cast will not gain 20% increased damage against enemies, while the cast will gain that bonus. Let's take a closer look at what the Weapon Expertise system does not work with. As mentioned above, any skill that does not have an Arsenal Selection will not gain any Weapon Expertise effects when it's cast, however there are a few more cases to be aware of: Let's talk through them. has several bugs associated with it being a new skill for Vessel of Hatred, and one of those bugs happens to be that it's not behaving properly with the Weapon Expertise system. Earthquakes and Dust Devils are weird because sometimes they are and sometimes they aren't considered a skill, and in this context spawning an Earthquake or a Dust Devil is considered casting a skill that can not have a weapon assigned to its cast, hence whenever one is spawned the game thought that you just used a skill without using a weapon for it, which means the entire Weapon Expertise system simply turns off. From testing we see that Weapon Expertise effects (in this case increased damage while ) disappear from the statsheet whenever a Lucky Hit direct damage proc from items occur. This means that the Weapon Expertise system sees these procs as casting a separate skill that deals damage without having a weapon assigned to it, and thus turns off when a damage proc happens. Do note that procs from does not show this behaviour, which is where the direct damage condition comes from. buff turning off Weapon Expertise effects is slightly baffling, however several tests have shown the effects turning off whenever the buff is gained/refreshed, meaning the Weapon Expertise system must see the buff as a separate skill cast that does not have an Arsenal Selection. Currently the Weapon Expertise effects behave differently depending on what weapon arsenal you're using for different damage types. The table below lists whether these Weapon Expertise effects: For example in the table we see that the increased damage against enemies has the following properties: with Direct hits simply means that even if does not gain any Weapon Expertise effects on its cast, you can swap to a Polearm immediately after casting and still gain the 15%[x] increased damage while effect for the pulses and even the initial hit if you have enough Attack Speed. We can also imagine the following example to show the One last thing to mention on the general Weapon Expertise topic. When you are wielding a weapon and also have that weapons bonus selected in the Technique slot, the first part of the Weapon Expertise effect (in this case 20%[x] increased damage against enemies with ) is added together with the bonus you get from simply using a weapon during and after a skill cast. So if you are wielding two 1-Handed Maces and also have that effect in the Technique slot you will deal 40%[x] increased damage against enemies when that effect is applicable. Same for goes e.g. - two instances of 10%[x] increased damage against enemies becomes 20%[x], and 15%[x] increased Lucky Hit with become 30%[x] increased Lucky Hit (note that this is a separate multiplier from Lucky Hit on gear). is part of the Weapon Expertise system that's available to Barbarians. It's made up of two parts: The technique part which is the same-ish effect as can be equipped at any time regardless of which weapon you're currently using, while the usage part which increases your damage after killing enemies only is active while you're using (holding in your hands) a 2-Handed Sword. The technique part is what's most commonly referred to when talking about , and we'll be doing the same going forward. Mechanically there's not much difference between , they both convert some percentage of the direct hits base damage to a on the target, however is limited to the following compared to Some notable examples to show this difference: The following interactions have been verified through damage recording or footage to ensure they are not functional.

The new Barbarian unique for Season 7 introduces a new mechanic, in the form of being able to detonate active Earthquakes for their total damage in one big hit by hitting them with a line that shoots out from your character when you use . Lets look at some of the affixes. . When an Earthquake is created the affix rolls a die, and if successful that Earthquake will deal double damage for all of its damage ticks and a subsequent explosion if detonated via the Unique effect. . The explosion damage is based off of the total damage an earthquake would deal over it's duration. So if we were to write out the damage an Earthquake would deal per tick it would look like: is from Earthquakes having a bug that makes them deal double damage compared to their tooltip values, and the represents the damage of 1 tick (4s duration with a tick every 0.5s). The total tick damage of an Earthquake and a detonation is simply written as: which is roughly the same amount when we account for the number of EQ ticks only going up by 1 every step of 12.5% duration, by comparison the explosion damage scales continously with more duration. Each Earthquake tick has a separate roll to cause a Critical Strike on each individual enemy hit, where as an Earthquake detonation just rolls a Critical Strike on each individual enemy hit as it's 1 instance of damage instead of several ticks. , if a multiplier snapshots to an Earthquake for its regular tick damage when that Earthquake is created, it will also be active for the detonation.

However if you're casting a skill that can not have a weapon selection assigned to it, you will not gain any additional effects for that skill cast because you're not a weapon for its cast. This difference can be seen with the tooltips below, where requires that an Arsenal Selection is assigned to it while does not have such a requirement. This means that if you cast while dual wielding 1-hand Maces, that cast will not gain 20% increased damage against enemies, while the cast will gain that bonus. Let's take a closer look at what the Weapon Expertise system does not work with. As mentioned above, any skill that does not have an Arsenal Selection will not gain any Weapon Expertise effects when it's cast, however there are a few more cases to be aware of: Let's talk through them. has several bugs associated with it being a new skill for Vessel of Hatred, and one of those bugs happens to be that it's not behaving properly with the Weapon Expertise system. Earthquakes and Dust Devils are weird because sometimes they are and sometimes they aren't considered a skill, and in this context spawning an Earthquake or a Dust Devil is considered casting a skill that can not have a weapon assigned to its cast, hence whenever one is spawned the game thought that you just used a skill without using a weapon for it, which means the entire Weapon Expertise system simply turns off. From testing we see that Weapon Expertise effects (in this case increased damage while ) disappear from the statsheet whenever a Lucky Hit direct damage proc from items occur. This means that the Weapon Expertise system sees these procs as casting a separate skill that deals damage without having a weapon assigned to it, and thus turns off when a damage proc happens. Do note that procs from does not show this behaviour, which is where the direct damage condition comes from. buff turning off Weapon Expertise effects is slightly baffling, however several tests have shown the effects turning off whenever the buff is gained/refreshed, meaning the Weapon Expertise system must see the buff as a separate skill cast that does not have an Arsenal Selection. Currently the Weapon Expertise effects behave differently depending on what weapon arsenal you're using for different damage types. The table below lists whether these Weapon Expertise effects: For example in the table we see that the increased damage against enemies has the following properties: with Direct hits simply means that even if does not gain any Weapon Expertise effects on its cast, you can swap to a Polearm immediately after casting and still gain the 15%[x] increased damage while effect for the pulses and even the initial hit if you have enough Attack Speed. We can also imagine the following example to show the One last thing to mention on the general Weapon Expertise topic. When you are wielding a weapon and also have that weapons bonus selected in the Technique slot, the first part of the Weapon Expertise effect (in this case 20%[x] increased damage against enemies with ) is added together with the bonus you get from simply using a weapon during and after a skill cast. So if you are wielding two 1-Handed Maces and also have that effect in the Technique slot you will deal 40%[x] increased damage against enemies when that effect is applicable. Same for goes e.g. - two instances of 10%[x] increased damage against enemies becomes 20%[x], and 15%[x] increased Lucky Hit with become 30%[x] increased Lucky Hit (note that this is a separate multiplier from Lucky Hit on gear). is part of the Weapon Expertise system that's available to Barbarians. It's made up of two parts: The technique part which is the same-ish effect as can be equipped at any time regardless of which weapon you're currently using, while the usage part which increases your damage after killing enemies only is active while you're using (holding in your hands) a 2-Handed Sword. The technique part is what's most commonly referred to when talking about , and we'll be doing the same going forward.

The total tick damage of an Earthquake and a detonation is simply written as: which is roughly the same amount when we account for the number of EQ ticks only going up by 1 every step of 12.5% duration, by comparison the explosion damage scales continously with more duration. Each Earthquake tick has a separate roll to cause a Critical Strike on each individual enemy hit, where as an Earthquake detonation just rolls a Critical Strike on each individual enemy hit as it's 1 instance of damage instead of several ticks. , if a multiplier snapshots to an Earthquake for its regular tick damage when that Earthquake is created, it will also be active for the detonation.

The Weapon Expertise system grant various effects when you're different weapons for your skill casts. is in bold because it's key to kind of understand what the Weapon Expertise system works or doesn't work with. Let's start with how the Weapon Expertise system works. The basic idea is that when you cast a skill that can have weapons assigned to it, also called an Arsenal Selection (Dual Wield, Bludgeoning or Slicing), that skill gains a bonus depending on the Arsenal Selection that you've made, i.e you're a weapon when casting a skill. However if you're casting a skill that can not have a weapon selection assigned to it, you will not gain any additional effects for that skill cast because you're not a weapon for its cast. This difference can be seen with the tooltips below, where requires that an Arsenal Selection is assigned to it while does not have such a requirement. This means that if you cast while dual wielding 1-hand Maces, that cast will not gain 20% increased damage against enemies, while the cast will gain that bonus. Let's take a closer look at what the Weapon Expertise system does not work with. As mentioned above, any skill that does not have an Arsenal Selection will not gain any Weapon Expertise effects when it's cast, however there are a few more cases to be aware of: Let's talk through them. has several bugs associated with it being a new skill for Vessel of Hatred, and one of those bugs happens to be that it's not behaving properly with the Weapon Expertise system. Earthquakes and Dust Devils are weird because sometimes they are and sometimes they aren't considered a skill, and in this context spawning an Earthquake or a Dust Devil is considered casting a skill that can not have a weapon assigned to its cast, hence whenever one is spawned the game thought that you just used a skill without using a weapon for it, which means the entire Weapon Expertise system simply turns off. From testing we see that Weapon Expertise effects (in this case increased damage while ) disappear from the statsheet whenever a Lucky Hit direct damage proc from items occur. This means that the Weapon Expertise system sees these procs as casting a separate skill that deals damage without having a weapon assigned to it, and thus turns off when a damage proc happens. Do note that procs from does not show this behaviour, which is where the direct damage condition comes from. buff turning off Weapon Expertise effects is slightly baffling, however several tests have shown the effects turning off whenever the buff is gained/refreshed, meaning the Weapon Expertise system must see the buff as a separate skill cast that does not have an Arsenal Selection. Currently the Weapon Expertise effects behave differently depending on what weapon arsenal you're using for different damage types. The table below lists whether these Weapon Expertise effects: For example in the table we see that the increased damage against enemies has the following properties: with Direct hits simply means that even if does not gain any Weapon Expertise effects on its cast, you can swap to a Polearm immediately after casting and still gain the 15%[x] increased damage while effect for the pulses and even the initial hit if you have enough Attack Speed. We can also imagine the following example to show the One last thing to mention on the general Weapon Expertise topic. When you are wielding a weapon and also have that weapons bonus selected in the Technique slot, the first part of the Weapon Expertise effect (in this case 20%[x] increased damage against enemies with ) is added together with the bonus you get from simply using a weapon during and after a skill cast. So if you are wielding two 1-Handed Maces and also have that effect in the Technique slot you will deal 40%[x] increased damage against enemies when that effect is applicable. Same for goes e.g. - two instances of 10%[x] increased damage against enemies becomes 20%[x], and 15%[x] increased Lucky Hit with become 30%[x] increased Lucky Hit (note that this is a separate multiplier from Lucky Hit on gear). is part of the Weapon Expertise system that's available to Barbarians. It's made up of two parts: The technique part which is the same-ish effect as can be equipped at any time regardless of which weapon you're currently using, while the usage part which increases your damage after killing enemies only is active while you're using (holding in your hands) a 2-Handed Sword. The technique part is what's most commonly referred to when talking about , and we'll be doing the same going forward. Mechanically there's not much difference between , they both convert some percentage of the direct hits base damage to a on the target, however is limited to the following compared to Some notable examples to show this difference: The following interactions have been verified through damage recording or footage to ensure they are not functional.

The new Barbarian unique for Season 7 introduces a new mechanic, in the form of being able to detonate active Earthquakes for their total damage in one big hit by hitting them with a line that shoots out from your character when you use . Lets look at some of the affixes. . When an Earthquake is created the affix rolls a die, and if successful that Earthquake will deal double damage for all of its damage ticks and a subsequent explosion if detonated via the Unique effect. . The explosion damage is based off of the total damage an earthquake would deal over it's duration. So if we were to write out the damage an Earthquake would deal per tick it would look like: is from Earthquakes having a bug that makes them deal double damage compared to their tooltip values, and the represents the damage of 1 tick (4s duration with a tick every 0.5s). The total tick damage of an Earthquake and a detonation is simply written as: which is roughly the same amount when we account for the number of EQ ticks only going up by 1 every step of 12.5% duration, by comparison the explosion damage scales continously with more duration. Each Earthquake tick has a separate roll to cause a Critical Strike on each individual enemy hit, where as an Earthquake detonation just rolls a Critical Strike on each individual enemy hit as it's 1 instance of damage instead of several ticks. , if a multiplier snapshots to an Earthquake for its regular tick damage when that Earthquake is created, it will also be active for the detonation.

The new Barbarian unique for Season 7 introduces a new mechanic, in the form of being able to detonate active Earthquakes for their total damage in one big hit by hitting them with a line that shoots out from your character when you use . Lets look at some of the affixes. . When an Earthquake is created the affix rolls a die, and if successful that Earthquake will deal double damage for all of its damage ticks and a subsequent explosion if detonated via the Unique effect. . The explosion damage is based off of the total damage an earthquake would deal over it's duration. So if we were to write out the damage an Earthquake would deal per tick it would look like: is from Earthquakes having a bug that makes them deal double damage compared to their tooltip values, and the represents the damage of 1 tick (4s duration with a tick every 0.5s). The total tick damage of an Earthquake and a detonation is simply written as: which is roughly the same amount when we account for the number of EQ ticks only going up by 1 every step of 12.5% duration, by comparison the explosion damage scales continously with more duration. Each Earthquake tick has a separate roll to cause a Critical Strike on each individual enemy hit, where as an Earthquake detonation just rolls a Critical Strike on each individual enemy hit as it's 1 instance of damage instead of several ticks. , if a multiplier snapshots to an Earthquake for its regular tick damage when that Earthquake is created, it will also be active for the detonation.

The Weapon Expertise system grant various effects when you're different weapons for your skill casts. is in bold because it's key to kind of understand what the Weapon Expertise system works or doesn't work with. Let's start with how the Weapon Expertise system works. The basic idea is that when you cast a skill that can have weapons assigned to it, also called an Arsenal Selection (Dual Wield, Bludgeoning or Slicing), that skill gains a bonus depending on the Arsenal Selection that you've made, i.e you're a weapon when casting a skill. However if you're casting a skill that can not have a weapon selection assigned to it, you will not gain any additional effects for that skill cast because you're not a weapon for its cast. This difference can be seen with the tooltips below, where requires that an Arsenal Selection is assigned to it while does not have such a requirement. This means that if you cast while dual wielding 1-hand Maces, that cast will not gain 20% increased damage against enemies, while the cast will gain that bonus. Let's take a closer look at what the Weapon Expertise system does not work with. As mentioned above, any skill that does not have an Arsenal Selection will not gain any Weapon Expertise effects when it's cast, however there are a few more cases to be aware of: Let's talk through them. has several bugs associated with it being a new skill for Vessel of Hatred, and one of those bugs happens to be that it's not behaving properly with the Weapon Expertise system. Earthquakes and Dust Devils are weird because sometimes they are and sometimes they aren't considered a skill, and in this context spawning an Earthquake or a Dust Devil is considered casting a skill that can not have a weapon assigned to its cast, hence whenever one is spawned the game thought that you just used a skill without using a weapon for it, which means the entire Weapon Expertise system simply turns off. From testing we see that Weapon Expertise effects (in this case increased damage while ) disappear from the statsheet whenever a Lucky Hit direct damage proc from items occur. This means that the Weapon Expertise system sees these procs as casting a separate skill that deals damage without having a weapon assigned to it, and thus turns off when a damage proc happens. Do note that procs from does not show this behaviour, which is where the direct damage condition comes from. buff turning off Weapon Expertise effects is slightly baffling, however several tests have shown the effects turning off whenever the buff is gained/refreshed, meaning the Weapon Expertise system must see the buff as a separate skill cast that does not have an Arsenal Selection. Currently the Weapon Expertise effects behave differently depending on what weapon arsenal you're using for different damage types. The table below lists whether these Weapon Expertise effects: For example in the table we see that the increased damage against enemies has the following properties: with Direct hits simply means that even if does not gain any Weapon Expertise effects on its cast, you can swap to a Polearm immediately after casting and still gain the 15%[x] increased damage while effect for the pulses and even the initial hit if you have enough Attack Speed. We can also imagine the following example to show the One last thing to mention on the general Weapon Expertise topic. When you are wielding a weapon and also have that weapons bonus selected in the Technique slot, the first part of the Weapon Expertise effect (in this case 20%[x] increased damage against enemies with ) is added together with the bonus you get from simply using a weapon during and after a skill cast. So if you are wielding two 1-Handed Maces and also have that effect in the Technique slot you will deal 40%[x] increased damage against enemies when that effect is applicable. Same for goes e.g. - two instances of 10%[x] increased damage against enemies becomes 20%[x], and 15%[x] increased Lucky Hit with become 30%[x] increased Lucky Hit (note that this is a separate multiplier from Lucky Hit on gear). is part of the Weapon Expertise system that's available to Barbarians. It's made up of two parts: The technique part which is the same-ish effect as can be equipped at any time regardless of which weapon you're currently using, while the usage part which increases your damage after killing enemies only is active while you're using (holding in your hands) a 2-Handed Sword. The technique part is what's most commonly referred to when talking about , and we'll be doing the same going forward.

The Weapon Expertise system grant various effects when you're different weapons for your skill casts. is in bold because it's key to kind of understand what the Weapon Expertise system works or doesn't work with. Let's start with how the Weapon Expertise system works. The basic idea is that when you cast a skill that can have weapons assigned to it, also called an Arsenal Selection (Dual Wield, Bludgeoning or Slicing), that skill gains a bonus depending on the Arsenal Selection that you've made, i.e you're a weapon when casting a skill. However if you're casting a skill that can not have a weapon selection assigned to it, you will not gain any additional effects for that skill cast because you're not a weapon for its cast. This difference can be seen with the tooltips below, where requires that an Arsenal Selection is assigned to it while does not have such a requirement. This means that if you cast while dual wielding 1-hand Maces, that cast will not gain 20% increased damage against enemies, while the cast will gain that bonus. Let's take a closer look at what the Weapon Expertise system does not work with. As mentioned above, any skill that does not have an Arsenal Selection will not gain any Weapon Expertise effects when it's cast, however there are a few more cases to be aware of: Let's talk through them. has several bugs associated with it being a new skill for Vessel of Hatred, and one of those bugs happens to be that it's not behaving properly with the Weapon Expertise system. Earthquakes and Dust Devils are weird because sometimes they are and sometimes they aren't considered a skill, and in this context spawning an Earthquake or a Dust Devil is considered casting a skill that can not have a weapon assigned to its cast, hence whenever one is spawned the game thought that you just used a skill without using a weapon for it, which means the entire Weapon Expertise system simply turns off. From testing we see that Weapon Expertise effects (in this case increased damage while ) disappear from the statsheet whenever a Lucky Hit direct damage proc from items occur. This means that the Weapon Expertise system sees these procs as casting a separate skill that deals damage without having a weapon assigned to it, and thus turns off when a damage proc happens. Do note that procs from does not show this behaviour, which is where the direct damage condition comes from. buff turning off Weapon Expertise effects is slightly baffling, however several tests have shown the effects turning off whenever the buff is gained/refreshed, meaning the Weapon Expertise system must see the buff as a separate skill cast that does not have an Arsenal Selection. Currently the Weapon Expertise effects behave differently depending on what weapon arsenal you're using for different damage types. The table below lists whether these Weapon Expertise effects: For example in the table we see that the increased damage against enemies has the following properties: with Direct hits simply means that even if does not gain any Weapon Expertise effects on its cast, you can swap to a Polearm immediately after casting and still gain the 15%[x] increased damage while effect for the pulses and even the initial hit if you have enough Attack Speed. We can also imagine the following example to show the One last thing to mention on the general Weapon Expertise topic. When you are wielding a weapon and also have that weapons bonus selected in the Technique slot, the first part of the Weapon Expertise effect (in this case 20%[x] increased damage against enemies with ) is added together with the bonus you get from simply using a weapon during and after a skill cast. So if you are wielding two 1-Handed Maces and also have that effect in the Technique slot you will deal 40%[x] increased damage against enemies when that effect is applicable. Same for goes e.g. - two instances of 10%[x] increased damage against enemies becomes 20%[x], and 15%[x] increased Lucky Hit with become 30%[x] increased Lucky Hit (note that this is a separate multiplier from Lucky Hit on gear). is part of the Weapon Expertise system that's available to Barbarians. It's made up of two parts: The technique part which is the same-ish effect as can be equipped at any time regardless of which weapon you're currently using, while the usage part which increases your damage after killing enemies only is active while you're using (holding in your hands) a 2-Handed Sword. The technique part is what's most commonly referred to when talking about , and we'll be doing the same going forward. Mechanically there's not much difference between , they both convert some percentage of the direct hits base damage to a on the target, however is limited to the following compared to Some notable examples to show this difference: The following interactions have been verified through damage recording or footage to ensure they are not functional.

The new Barbarian unique for Season 7 introduces a new mechanic, in the form of being able to detonate active Earthquakes for their total damage in one big hit by hitting them with a line that shoots out from your character when you use . Lets look at some of the affixes. . When an Earthquake is created the affix rolls a die, and if successful that Earthquake will deal double damage for all of its damage ticks and a subsequent explosion if detonated via the Unique effect. . The explosion damage is based off of the total damage an earthquake would deal over it's duration. So if we were to write out the damage an Earthquake would deal per tick it would look like: is from Earthquakes having a bug that makes them deal double damage compared to their tooltip values, and the represents the damage of 1 tick (4s duration with a tick every 0.5s). The total tick damage of an Earthquake and a detonation is simply written as: which is roughly the same amount when we account for the number of EQ ticks only going up by 1 every step of 12.5% duration, by comparison the explosion damage scales continously with more duration. Each Earthquake tick has a separate roll to cause a Critical Strike on each individual enemy hit, where as an Earthquake detonation just rolls a Critical Strike on each individual enemy hit as it's 1 instance of damage instead of several ticks. , if a multiplier snapshots to an Earthquake for its regular tick damage when that Earthquake is created, it will also be active for the detonation.

The Weapon Expertise system grant various effects when you're different weapons for your skill casts. is in bold because it's key to kind of understand what the Weapon Expertise system works or doesn't work with. Let's start with how the Weapon Expertise system works. The basic idea is that when you cast a skill that can have weapons assigned to it, also called an Arsenal Selection (Dual Wield, Bludgeoning or Slicing), that skill gains a bonus depending on the Arsenal Selection that you've made, i.e you're a weapon when casting a skill. However if you're casting a skill that can not have a weapon selection assigned to it, you will not gain any additional effects for that skill cast because you're not a weapon for its cast. This difference can be seen with the tooltips below, where requires that an Arsenal Selection is assigned to it while does not have such a requirement. This means that if you cast while dual wielding 1-hand Maces, that cast will not gain 20% increased damage against enemies, while the cast will gain that bonus. Let's take a closer look at what the Weapon Expertise system does not work with. As mentioned above, any skill that does not have an Arsenal Selection will not gain any Weapon Expertise effects when it's cast, however there are a few more cases to be aware of: Let's talk through them. has several bugs associated with it being a new skill for Vessel of Hatred, and one of those bugs happens to be that it's not behaving properly with the Weapon Expertise system. Earthquakes and Dust Devils are weird because sometimes they are and sometimes they aren't considered a skill, and in this context spawning an Earthquake or a Dust Devil is considered casting a skill that can not have a weapon assigned to its cast, hence whenever one is spawned the game thought that you just used a skill without using a weapon for it, which means the entire Weapon Expertise system simply turns off. From testing we see that Weapon Expertise effects (in this case increased damage while ) disappear from the statsheet whenever a Lucky Hit direct damage proc from items occur. This means that the Weapon Expertise system sees these procs as casting a separate skill that deals damage without having a weapon assigned to it, and thus turns off when a damage proc happens. Do note that procs from does not show this behaviour, which is where the direct damage condition comes from. buff turning off Weapon Expertise effects is slightly baffling, however several tests have shown the effects turning off whenever the buff is gained/refreshed, meaning the Weapon Expertise system must see the buff as a separate skill cast that does not have an Arsenal Selection. Currently the Weapon Expertise effects behave differently depending on what weapon arsenal you're using for different damage types. The table below lists whether these Weapon Expertise effects: For example in the table we see that the increased damage against enemies has the following properties: with Direct hits simply means that even if does not gain any Weapon Expertise effects on its cast, you can swap to a Polearm immediately after casting and still gain the 15%[x] increased damage while effect for the pulses and even the initial hit if you have enough Attack Speed. We can also imagine the following example to show the One last thing to mention on the general Weapon Expertise topic. When you are wielding a weapon and also have that weapons bonus selected in the Technique slot, the first part of the Weapon Expertise effect (in this case 20%[x] increased damage against enemies with ) is added together with the bonus you get from simply using a weapon during and after a skill cast. So if you are wielding two 1-Handed Maces and also have that effect in the Technique slot you will deal 40%[x] increased damage against enemies when that effect is applicable. Same for goes e.g. - two instances of 10%[x] increased damage against enemies becomes 20%[x], and 15%[x] increased Lucky Hit with become 30%[x] increased Lucky Hit (note that this is a separate multiplier from Lucky Hit on gear). is part of the Weapon Expertise system that's available to Barbarians. It's made up of two parts: The technique part which is the same-ish effect as can be equipped at any time regardless of which weapon you're currently using, while the usage part which increases your damage after killing enemies only is active while you're using (holding in your hands) a 2-Handed Sword. The technique part is what's most commonly referred to when talking about , and we'll be doing the same going forward. Mechanically there's not much difference between , they both convert some percentage of the direct hits base damage to a on the target, however is limited to the following compared to Some notable examples to show this difference: The following interactions have been verified through damage recording or footage to ensure they are not functional.

The new Barbarian unique for Season 7 introduces a new mechanic, in the form of being able to detonate active Earthquakes for their total damage in one big hit by hitting them with a line that shoots out from your character when you use . Lets look at some of the affixes. . When an Earthquake is created the affix rolls a die, and if successful that Earthquake will deal double damage for all of its damage ticks and a subsequent explosion if detonated via the Unique effect. . The explosion damage is based off of the total damage an earthquake would deal over it's duration. So if we were to write out the damage an Earthquake would deal per tick it would look like: is from Earthquakes having a bug that makes them deal double damage compared to their tooltip values, and the represents the damage of 1 tick (4s duration with a tick every 0.5s). The total tick damage of an Earthquake and a detonation is simply written as: which is roughly the same amount when we account for the number of EQ ticks only going up by 1 every step of 12.5% duration, by comparison the explosion damage scales continously with more duration. Each Earthquake tick has a separate roll to cause a Critical Strike on each individual enemy hit, where as an Earthquake detonation just rolls a Critical Strike on each individual enemy hit as it's 1 instance of damage instead of several ticks. , if a multiplier snapshots to an Earthquake for its regular tick damage when that Earthquake is created, it will also be active for the detonation.

The Weapon Expertise system grant various effects when you're different weapons for your skill casts. is in bold because it's key to kind of understand what the Weapon Expertise system works or doesn't work with. Let's start with how the Weapon Expertise system works. The basic idea is that when you cast a skill that can have weapons assigned to it, also called an Arsenal Selection (Dual Wield, Bludgeoning or Slicing), that skill gains a bonus depending on the Arsenal Selection that you've made, i.e you're a weapon when casting a skill. However if you're casting a skill that can not have a weapon selection assigned to it, you will not gain any additional effects for that skill cast because you're not a weapon for its cast. This difference can be seen with the tooltips below, where requires that an Arsenal Selection is assigned to it while does not have such a requirement. This means that if you cast while dual wielding 1-hand Maces, that cast will not gain 20% increased damage against enemies, while the cast will gain that bonus. Let's take a closer look at what the Weapon Expertise system does not work with. As mentioned above, any skill that does not have an Arsenal Selection will not gain any Weapon Expertise effects when it's cast, however there are a few more cases to be aware of: Let's talk through them. has several bugs associated with it being a new skill for Vessel of Hatred, and one of those bugs happens to be that it's not behaving properly with the Weapon Expertise system. Earthquakes and Dust Devils are weird because sometimes they are and sometimes they aren't considered a skill, and in this context spawning an Earthquake or a Dust Devil is considered casting a skill that can not have a weapon assigned to its cast, hence whenever one is spawned the game thought that you just used a skill without using a weapon for it, which means the entire Weapon Expertise system simply turns off. From testing we see that Weapon Expertise effects (in this case increased damage while ) disappear from the statsheet whenever a Lucky Hit direct damage proc from items occur. This means that the Weapon Expertise system sees these procs as casting a separate skill that deals damage without having a weapon assigned to it, and thus turns off when a damage proc happens. Do note that procs from does not show this behaviour, which is where the direct damage condition comes from. buff turning off Weapon Expertise effects is slightly baffling, however several tests have shown the effects turning off whenever the buff is gained/refreshed, meaning the Weapon Expertise system must see the buff as a separate skill cast that does not have an Arsenal Selection. Currently the Weapon Expertise effects behave differently depending on what weapon arsenal you're using for different damage types. The table below lists whether these Weapon Expertise effects: For example in the table we see that the increased damage against enemies has the following properties: with Direct hits simply means that even if does not gain any Weapon Expertise effects on its cast, you can swap to a Polearm immediately after casting and still gain the 15%[x] increased damage while effect for the pulses and even the initial hit if you have enough Attack Speed. We can also imagine the following example to show the One last thing to mention on the general Weapon Expertise topic. When you are wielding a weapon and also have that weapons bonus selected in the Technique slot, the first part of the Weapon Expertise effect (in this case 20%[x] increased damage against enemies with ) is added together with the bonus you get from simply using a weapon during and after a skill cast. So if you are wielding two 1-Handed Maces and also have that effect in the Technique slot you will deal 40%[x] increased damage against enemies when that effect is applicable. Same for goes e.g. - two instances of 10%[x] increased damage against enemies becomes 20%[x], and 15%[x] increased Lucky Hit with become 30%[x] increased Lucky Hit (note that this is a separate multiplier from Lucky Hit on gear). is part of the Weapon Expertise system that's available to Barbarians. It's made up of two parts: The technique part which is the same-ish effect as can be equipped at any time regardless of which weapon you're currently using, while the usage part which increases your damage after killing enemies only is active while you're using (holding in your hands) a 2-Handed Sword. The technique part is what's most commonly referred to when talking about , and we'll be doing the same going forward. Mechanically there's not much difference between , they both convert some percentage of the direct hits base damage to a on the target, however is limited to the following compared to Some notable examples to show this difference: The following interactions have been verified through damage recording or footage to ensure they are not functional.

Lets look at some of the affixes. . When an Earthquake is created the affix rolls a die, and if successful that Earthquake will deal double damage for all of its damage ticks and a subsequent explosion if detonated via the Unique effect. . The explosion damage is based off of the total damage an earthquake would deal over it's duration. So if we were to write out the damage an Earthquake would deal per tick it would look like: is from Earthquakes having a bug that makes them deal double damage compared to their tooltip values, and the represents the damage of 1 tick (4s duration with a tick every 0.5s). The total tick damage of an Earthquake and a detonation is simply written as: which is roughly the same amount when we account for the number of EQ ticks only going up by 1 every step of 12.5% duration, by comparison the explosion damage scales continously with more duration. Each Earthquake tick has a separate roll to cause a Critical Strike on each individual enemy hit, where as an Earthquake detonation just rolls a Critical Strike on each individual enemy hit as it's 1 instance of damage instead of several ticks. , if a multiplier snapshots to an Earthquake for its regular tick damage when that Earthquake is created, it will also be active for the detonation.

The Weapon Expertise system grant various effects when you're different weapons for your skill casts. is in bold because it's key to kind of understand what the Weapon Expertise system works or doesn't work with. Let's start with how the Weapon Expertise system works. The basic idea is that when you cast a skill that can have weapons assigned to it, also called an Arsenal Selection (Dual Wield, Bludgeoning or Slicing), that skill gains a bonus depending on the Arsenal Selection that you've made, i.e you're a weapon when casting a skill. However if you're casting a skill that can not have a weapon selection assigned to it, you will not gain any additional effects for that skill cast because you're not a weapon for its cast. This difference can be seen with the tooltips below, where requires that an Arsenal Selection is assigned to it while does not have such a requirement. This means that if you cast while dual wielding 1-hand Maces, that cast will not gain 20% increased damage against enemies, while the cast will gain that bonus. Let's take a closer look at what the Weapon Expertise system does not work with. As mentioned above, any skill that does not have an Arsenal Selection will not gain any Weapon Expertise effects when it's cast, however there are a few more cases to be aware of: Let's talk through them. has several bugs associated with it being a new skill for Vessel of Hatred, and one of those bugs happens to be that it's not behaving properly with the Weapon Expertise system. Earthquakes and Dust Devils are weird because sometimes they are and sometimes they aren't considered a skill, and in this context spawning an Earthquake or a Dust Devil is considered casting a skill that can not have a weapon assigned to its cast, hence whenever one is spawned the game thought that you just used a skill without using a weapon for it, which means the entire Weapon Expertise system simply turns off. From testing we see that Weapon Expertise effects (in this case increased damage while ) disappear from the statsheet whenever a Lucky Hit direct damage proc from items occur. This means that the Weapon Expertise system sees these procs as casting a separate skill that deals damage without having a weapon assigned to it, and thus turns off when a damage proc happens. Do note that procs from does not show this behaviour, which is where the direct damage condition comes from. buff turning off Weapon Expertise effects is slightly baffling, however several tests have shown the effects turning off whenever the buff is gained/refreshed, meaning the Weapon Expertise system must see the buff as a separate skill cast that does not have an Arsenal Selection. Currently the Weapon Expertise effects behave differently depending on what weapon arsenal you're using for different damage types. The table below lists whether these Weapon Expertise effects: For example in the table we see that the increased damage against enemies has the following properties: with Direct hits simply means that even if does not gain any Weapon Expertise effects on its cast, you can swap to a Polearm immediately after casting and still gain the 15%[x] increased damage while effect for the pulses and even the initial hit if you have enough Attack Speed. We can also imagine the following example to show the One last thing to mention on the general Weapon Expertise topic. When you are wielding a weapon and also have that weapons bonus selected in the Technique slot, the first part of the Weapon Expertise effect (in this case 20%[x] increased damage against enemies with ) is added together with the bonus you get from simply using a weapon during and after a skill cast. So if you are wielding two 1-Handed Maces and also have that effect in the Technique slot you will deal 40%[x] increased damage against enemies when that effect is applicable. Same for goes e.g. - two instances of 10%[x] increased damage against enemies becomes 20%[x], and 15%[x] increased Lucky Hit with become 30%[x] increased Lucky Hit (note that this is a separate multiplier from Lucky Hit on gear). is part of the Weapon Expertise system that's available to Barbarians. It's made up of two parts: The technique part which is the same-ish effect as can be equipped at any time regardless of which weapon you're currently using, while the usage part which increases your damage after killing enemies only is active while you're using (holding in your hands) a 2-Handed Sword. The technique part is what's most commonly referred to when talking about , and we'll be doing the same going forward.

The new Barbarian unique for Season 7 introduces a new mechanic, in the form of being able to detonate active Earthquakes for their total damage in one big hit by hitting them with a line that shoots out from your character when you use . Lets look at some of the affixes. . When an Earthquake is created the affix rolls a die, and if successful that Earthquake will deal double damage for all of its damage ticks and a subsequent explosion if detonated via the Unique effect. . The explosion damage is based off of the total damage an earthquake would deal over it's duration. So if we were to write out the damage an Earthquake would deal per tick it would look like: is from Earthquakes having a bug that makes them deal double damage compared to their tooltip values, and the represents the damage of 1 tick (4s duration with a tick every 0.5s). The total tick damage of an Earthquake and a detonation is simply written as: which is roughly the same amount when we account for the number of EQ ticks only going up by 1 every step of 12.5% duration, by comparison the explosion damage scales continously with more duration. Each Earthquake tick has a separate roll to cause a Critical Strike on each individual enemy hit, where as an Earthquake detonation just rolls a Critical Strike on each individual enemy hit as it's 1 instance of damage instead of several ticks. , if a multiplier snapshots to an Earthquake for its regular tick damage when that Earthquake is created, it will also be active for the detonation.

The Weapon Expertise system grant various effects when you're different weapons for your skill casts. is in bold because it's key to kind of understand what the Weapon Expertise system works or doesn't work with. Let's start with how the Weapon Expertise system works. The basic idea is that when you cast a skill that can have weapons assigned to it, also called an Arsenal Selection (Dual Wield, Bludgeoning or Slicing), that skill gains a bonus depending on the Arsenal Selection that you've made, i.e you're a weapon when casting a skill. However if you're casting a skill that can not have a weapon selection assigned to it, you will not gain any additional effects for that skill cast because you're not a weapon for its cast. This difference can be seen with the tooltips below, where requires that an Arsenal Selection is assigned to it while does not have such a requirement. This means that if you cast while dual wielding 1-hand Maces, that cast will not gain 20% increased damage against enemies, while the cast will gain that bonus. Let's take a closer look at what the Weapon Expertise system does not work with. As mentioned above, any skill that does not have an Arsenal Selection will not gain any Weapon Expertise effects when it's cast, however there are a few more cases to be aware of: Let's talk through them. has several bugs associated with it being a new skill for Vessel of Hatred, and one of those bugs happens to be that it's not behaving properly with the Weapon Expertise system. Earthquakes and Dust Devils are weird because sometimes they are and sometimes they aren't considered a skill, and in this context spawning an Earthquake or a Dust Devil is considered casting a skill that can not have a weapon assigned to its cast, hence whenever one is spawned the game thought that you just used a skill without using a weapon for it, which means the entire Weapon Expertise system simply turns off. From testing we see that Weapon Expertise effects (in this case increased damage while ) disappear from the statsheet whenever a Lucky Hit direct damage proc from items occur. This means that the Weapon Expertise system sees these procs as casting a separate skill that deals damage without having a weapon assigned to it, and thus turns off when a damage proc happens. Do note that procs from does not show this behaviour, which is where the direct damage condition comes from. buff turning off Weapon Expertise effects is slightly baffling, however several tests have shown the effects turning off whenever the buff is gained/refreshed, meaning the Weapon Expertise system must see the buff as a separate skill cast that does not have an Arsenal Selection. Currently the Weapon Expertise effects behave differently depending on what weapon arsenal you're using for different damage types. The table below lists whether these Weapon Expertise effects: For example in the table we see that the increased damage against enemies has the following properties: with Direct hits simply means that even if does not gain any Weapon Expertise effects on its cast, you can swap to a Polearm immediately after casting and still gain the 15%[x] increased damage while effect for the pulses and even the initial hit if you have enough Attack Speed. We can also imagine the following example to show the One last thing to mention on the general Weapon Expertise topic. When you are wielding a weapon and also have that weapons bonus selected in the Technique slot, the first part of the Weapon Expertise effect (in this case 20%[x] increased damage against enemies with ) is added together with the bonus you get from simply using a weapon during and after a skill cast. So if you are wielding two 1-Handed Maces and also have that effect in the Technique slot you will deal 40%[x] increased damage against enemies when that effect is applicable. Same for goes e.g. - two instances of 10%[x] increased damage against enemies becomes 20%[x], and 15%[x] increased Lucky Hit with become 30%[x] increased Lucky Hit (note that this is a separate multiplier from Lucky Hit on gear). is part of the Weapon Expertise system that's available to Barbarians. It's made up of two parts: The technique part which is the same-ish effect as can be equipped at any time regardless of which weapon you're currently using, while the usage part which increases your damage after killing enemies only is active while you're using (holding in your hands) a 2-Handed Sword. The technique part is what's most commonly referred to when talking about , and we'll be doing the same going forward. Mechanically there's not much difference between , they both convert some percentage of the direct hits base damage to a on the target, however is limited to the following compared to Some notable examples to show this difference: The following interactions have been verified through damage recording or footage to ensure they are not functional.

The new Barbarian unique for Season 7 introduces a new mechanic, in the form of being able to detonate active Earthquakes for their total damage in one big hit by hitting them with a line that shoots out from your character when you use . Lets look at some of the affixes. . When an Earthquake is created the affix rolls a die, and if successful that Earthquake will deal double damage for all of its damage ticks and a subsequent explosion if detonated via the Unique effect. . The explosion damage is based off of the total damage an earthquake would deal over it's duration. So if we were to write out the damage an Earthquake would deal per tick it would look like: is from Earthquakes having a bug that makes them deal double damage compared to their tooltip values, and the represents the damage of 1 tick (4s duration with a tick every 0.5s). The total tick damage of an Earthquake and a detonation is simply written as: which is roughly the same amount when we account for the number of EQ ticks only going up by 1 every step of 12.5% duration, by comparison the explosion damage scales continously with more duration. Each Earthquake tick has a separate roll to cause a Critical Strike on each individual enemy hit, where as an Earthquake detonation just rolls a Critical Strike on each individual enemy hit as it's 1 instance of damage instead of several ticks. , if a multiplier snapshots to an Earthquake for its regular tick damage when that Earthquake is created, it will also be active for the detonation.

The Weapon Expertise system grant various effects when you're different weapons for your skill casts. is in bold because it's key to kind of understand what the Weapon Expertise system works or doesn't work with. Let's start with how the Weapon Expertise system works. The basic idea is that when you cast a skill that can have weapons assigned to it, also called an Arsenal Selection (Dual Wield, Bludgeoning or Slicing), that skill gains a bonus depending on the Arsenal Selection that you've made, i.e you're a weapon when casting a skill. However if you're casting a skill that can not have a weapon selection assigned to it, you will not gain any additional effects for that skill cast because you're not a weapon for its cast. This difference can be seen with the tooltips below, where requires that an Arsenal Selection is assigned to it while does not have such a requirement. This means that if you cast while dual wielding 1-hand Maces, that cast will not gain 20% increased damage against enemies, while the cast will gain that bonus. Let's take a closer look at what the Weapon Expertise system does not work with. As mentioned above, any skill that does not have an Arsenal Selection will not gain any Weapon Expertise effects when it's cast, however there are a few more cases to be aware of: Let's talk through them. has several bugs associated with it being a new skill for Vessel of Hatred, and one of those bugs happens to be that it's not behaving properly with the Weapon Expertise system. Earthquakes and Dust Devils are weird because sometimes they are and sometimes they aren't considered a skill, and in this context spawning an Earthquake or a Dust Devil is considered casting a skill that can not have a weapon assigned to its cast, hence whenever one is spawned the game thought that you just used a skill without using a weapon for it, which means the entire Weapon Expertise system simply turns off. From testing we see that Weapon Expertise effects (in this case increased damage while ) disappear from the statsheet whenever a Lucky Hit direct damage proc from items occur. This means that the Weapon Expertise system sees these procs as casting a separate skill that deals damage without having a weapon assigned to it, and thus turns off when a damage proc happens. Do note that procs from does not show this behaviour, which is where the direct damage condition comes from. buff turning off Weapon Expertise effects is slightly baffling, however several tests have shown the effects turning off whenever the buff is gained/refreshed, meaning the Weapon Expertise system must see the buff as a separate skill cast that does not have an Arsenal Selection. Currently the Weapon Expertise effects behave differently depending on what weapon arsenal you're using for different damage types. The table below lists whether these Weapon Expertise effects: For example in the table we see that the increased damage against enemies has the following properties: with Direct hits simply means that even if does not gain any Weapon Expertise effects on its cast, you can swap to a Polearm immediately after casting and still gain the 15%[x] increased damage while effect for the pulses and even the initial hit if you have enough Attack Speed. We can also imagine the following example to show the One last thing to mention on the general Weapon Expertise topic. When you are wielding a weapon and also have that weapons bonus selected in the Technique slot, the first part of the Weapon Expertise effect (in this case 20%[x] increased damage against enemies with ) is added together with the bonus you get from simply using a weapon during and after a skill cast. So if you are wielding two 1-Handed Maces and also have that effect in the Technique slot you will deal 40%[x] increased damage against enemies when that effect is applicable. Same for goes e.g. - two instances of 10%[x] increased damage against enemies becomes 20%[x], and 15%[x] increased Lucky Hit with become 30%[x] increased Lucky Hit (note that this is a separate multiplier from Lucky Hit on gear). is part of the Weapon Expertise system that's available to Barbarians. It's made up of two parts: The technique part which is the same-ish effect as can be equipped at any time regardless of which weapon you're currently using, while the usage part which increases your damage after killing enemies only is active while you're using (holding in your hands) a 2-Handed Sword. The technique part is what's most commonly referred to when talking about , and we'll be doing the same going forward. Mechanically there's not much difference between , they both convert some percentage of the direct hits base damage to a on the target, however is limited to the following compared to Some notable examples to show this difference: The following interactions have been verified through damage recording or footage to ensure they are not functional.

The new Barbarian unique for Season 7 introduces a new mechanic, in the form of being able to detonate active Earthquakes for their total damage in one big hit by hitting them with a line that shoots out from your character when you use . Lets look at some of the affixes. . When an Earthquake is created the affix rolls a die, and if successful that Earthquake will deal double damage for all of its damage ticks and a subsequent explosion if detonated via the Unique effect. . The explosion damage is based off of the total damage an earthquake would deal over it's duration. So if we were to write out the damage an Earthquake would deal per tick it would look like: is from Earthquakes having a bug that makes them deal double damage compared to their tooltip values, and the represents the damage of 1 tick (4s duration with a tick every 0.5s). The total tick damage of an Earthquake and a detonation is simply written as: which is roughly the same amount when we account for the number of EQ ticks only going up by 1 every step of 12.5% duration, by comparison the explosion damage scales continously with more duration. Each Earthquake tick has a separate roll to cause a Critical Strike on each individual enemy hit, where as an Earthquake detonation just rolls a Critical Strike on each individual enemy hit as it's 1 instance of damage instead of several ticks. , if a multiplier snapshots to an Earthquake for its regular tick damage when that Earthquake is created, it will also be active for the detonation.

The Weapon Expertise system grant various effects when you're different weapons for your skill casts. is in bold because it's key to kind of understand what the Weapon Expertise system works or doesn't work with. Let's start with how the Weapon Expertise system works. The basic idea is that when you cast a skill that can have weapons assigned to it, also called an Arsenal Selection (Dual Wield, Bludgeoning or Slicing), that skill gains a bonus depending on the Arsenal Selection that you've made, i.e you're a weapon when casting a skill. However if you're casting a skill that can not have a weapon selection assigned to it, you will not gain any additional effects for that skill cast because you're not a weapon for its cast. This difference can be seen with the tooltips below, where requires that an Arsenal Selection is assigned to it while does not have such a requirement. This means that if you cast while dual wielding 1-hand Maces, that cast will not gain 20% increased damage against enemies, while the cast will gain that bonus. Let's take a closer look at what the Weapon Expertise system does not work with. As mentioned above, any skill that does not have an Arsenal Selection will not gain any Weapon Expertise effects when it's cast, however there are a few more cases to be aware of: Let's talk through them. has several bugs associated with it being a new skill for Vessel of Hatred, and one of those bugs happens to be that it's not behaving properly with the Weapon Expertise system. Earthquakes and Dust Devils are weird because sometimes they are and sometimes they aren't considered a skill, and in this context spawning an Earthquake or a Dust Devil is considered casting a skill that can not have a weapon assigned to its cast, hence whenever one is spawned the game thought that you just used a skill without using a weapon for it, which means the entire Weapon Expertise system simply turns off. From testing we see that Weapon Expertise effects (in this case increased damage while ) disappear from the statsheet whenever a Lucky Hit direct damage proc from items occur. This means that the Weapon Expertise system sees these procs as casting a separate skill that deals damage without having a weapon assigned to it, and thus turns off when a damage proc happens. Do note that procs from does not show this behaviour, which is where the direct damage condition comes from. buff turning off Weapon Expertise effects is slightly baffling, however several tests have shown the effects turning off whenever the buff is gained/refreshed, meaning the Weapon Expertise system must see the buff as a separate skill cast that does not have an Arsenal Selection. Currently the Weapon Expertise effects behave differently depending on what weapon arsenal you're using for different damage types. The table below lists whether these Weapon Expertise effects: For example in the table we see that the increased damage against enemies has the following properties: with Direct hits simply means that even if does not gain any Weapon Expertise effects on its cast, you can swap to a Polearm immediately after casting and still gain the 15%[x] increased damage while effect for the pulses and even the initial hit if you have enough Attack Speed. We can also imagine the following example to show the One last thing to mention on the general Weapon Expertise topic. When you are wielding a weapon and also have that weapons bonus selected in the Technique slot, the first part of the Weapon Expertise effect (in this case 20%[x] increased damage against enemies with ) is added together with the bonus you get from simply using a weapon during and after a skill cast. So if you are wielding two 1-Handed Maces and also have that effect in the Technique slot you will deal 40%[x] increased damage against enemies when that effect is applicable. Same for goes e.g. - two instances of 10%[x] increased damage against enemies becomes 20%[x], and 15%[x] increased Lucky Hit with become 30%[x] increased Lucky Hit (note that this is a separate multiplier from Lucky Hit on gear). is part of the Weapon Expertise system that's available to Barbarians. It's made up of two parts: The technique part which is the same-ish effect as can be equipped at any time regardless of which weapon you're currently using, while the usage part which increases your damage after killing enemies only is active while you're using (holding in your hands) a 2-Handed Sword. The technique part is what's most commonly referred to when talking about , and we'll be doing the same going forward. Mechanically there's not much difference between , they both convert some percentage of the direct hits base damage to a on the target, however is limited to the following compared to Some notable examples to show this difference: The following interactions have been verified through damage recording or footage to ensure they are not functional.

The new Barbarian unique for Season 7 introduces a new mechanic, in the form of being able to detonate active Earthquakes for their total damage in one big hit by hitting them with a line that shoots out from your character when you use . Lets look at some of the affixes. . When an Earthquake is created the affix rolls a die, and if successful that Earthquake will deal double damage for all of its damage ticks and a subsequent explosion if detonated via the Unique effect. . The explosion damage is based off of the total damage an earthquake would deal over it's duration. So if we were to write out the damage an Earthquake would deal per tick it would look like: is from Earthquakes having a bug that makes them deal double damage compared to their tooltip values, and the represents the damage of 1 tick (4s duration with a tick every 0.5s). The total tick damage of an Earthquake and a detonation is simply written as: which is roughly the same amount when we account for the number of EQ ticks only going up by 1 every step of 12.5% duration, by comparison the explosion damage scales continously with more duration. Each Earthquake tick has a separate roll to cause a Critical Strike on each individual enemy hit, where as an Earthquake detonation just rolls a Critical Strike on each individual enemy hit as it's 1 instance of damage instead of several ticks. , if a multiplier snapshots to an Earthquake for its regular tick damage when that Earthquake is created, it will also be active for the detonation.

The basic idea is that when you cast a skill that can have weapons assigned to it, also called an Arsenal Selection (Dual Wield, Bludgeoning or Slicing), that skill gains a bonus depending on the Arsenal Selection that you've made, i.e you're a weapon when casting a skill. However if you're casting a skill that can not have a weapon selection assigned to it, you will not gain any additional effects for that skill cast because you're not a weapon for its cast. This difference can be seen with the tooltips below, where requires that an Arsenal Selection is assigned to it while does not have such a requirement. This means that if you cast while dual wielding 1-hand Maces, that cast will not gain 20% increased damage against enemies, while the cast will gain that bonus. Let's take a closer look at what the Weapon Expertise system does not work with. As mentioned above, any skill that does not have an Arsenal Selection will not gain any Weapon Expertise effects when it's cast, however there are a few more cases to be aware of: Let's talk through them. has several bugs associated with it being a new skill for Vessel of Hatred, and one of those bugs happens to be that it's not behaving properly with the Weapon Expertise system. Earthquakes and Dust Devils are weird because sometimes they are and sometimes they aren't considered a skill, and in this context spawning an Earthquake or a Dust Devil is considered casting a skill that can not have a weapon assigned to its cast, hence whenever one is spawned the game thought that you just used a skill without using a weapon for it, which means the entire Weapon Expertise system simply turns off. From testing we see that Weapon Expertise effects (in this case increased damage while ) disappear from the statsheet whenever a Lucky Hit direct damage proc from items occur. This means that the Weapon Expertise system sees these procs as casting a separate skill that deals damage without having a weapon assigned to it, and thus turns off when a damage proc happens. Do note that procs from does not show this behaviour, which is where the direct damage condition comes from. buff turning off Weapon Expertise effects is slightly baffling, however several tests have shown the effects turning off whenever the buff is gained/refreshed, meaning the Weapon Expertise system must see the buff as a separate skill cast that does not have an Arsenal Selection. Currently the Weapon Expertise effects behave differently depending on what weapon arsenal you're using for different damage types. The table below lists whether these Weapon Expertise effects: For example in the table we see that the increased damage against enemies has the following properties: with Direct hits simply means that even if does not gain any Weapon Expertise effects on its cast, you can swap to a Polearm immediately after casting and still gain the 15%[x] increased damage while effect for the pulses and even the initial hit if you have enough Attack Speed. We can also imagine the following example to show the One last thing to mention on the general Weapon Expertise topic. When you are wielding a weapon and also have that weapons bonus selected in the Technique slot, the first part of the Weapon Expertise effect (in this case 20%[x] increased damage against enemies with ) is added together with the bonus you get from simply using a weapon during and after a skill cast. So if you are wielding two 1-Handed Maces and also have that effect in the Technique slot you will deal 40%[x] increased damage against enemies when that effect is applicable. Same for goes e.g. - two instances of 10%[x] increased damage against enemies becomes 20%[x], and 15%[x] increased Lucky Hit with become 30%[x] increased Lucky Hit (note that this is a separate multiplier from Lucky Hit on gear). is part of the Weapon Expertise system that's available to Barbarians. It's made up of two parts: The technique part which is the same-ish effect as can be equipped at any time regardless of which weapon you're currently using, while the usage part which increases your damage after killing enemies only is active while you're using (holding in your hands) a 2-Handed Sword. The technique part is what's most commonly referred to when talking about , and we'll be doing the same going forward. Mechanically there's not much difference between , they both convert some percentage of the direct hits base damage to a on the target, however is limited to the following compared to Some notable examples to show this difference: The following interactions have been verified through damage recording or footage to ensure they are not functional.

The new Barbarian unique for Season 7 introduces a new mechanic, in the form of being able to detonate active Earthquakes for their total damage in one big hit by hitting them with a line that shoots out from your character when you use . Lets look at some of the affixes. . When an Earthquake is created the affix rolls a die, and if successful that Earthquake will deal double damage for all of its damage ticks and a subsequent explosion if detonated via the Unique effect. . The explosion damage is based off of the total damage an earthquake would deal over it's duration. So if we were to write out the damage an Earthquake would deal per tick it would look like: is from Earthquakes having a bug that makes them deal double damage compared to their tooltip values, and the represents the damage of 1 tick (4s duration with a tick every 0.5s). The total tick damage of an Earthquake and a detonation is simply written as: which is roughly the same amount when we account for the number of EQ ticks only going up by 1 every step of 12.5% duration, by comparison the explosion damage scales continously with more duration. Each Earthquake tick has a separate roll to cause a Critical Strike on each individual enemy hit, where as an Earthquake detonation just rolls a Critical Strike on each individual enemy hit as it's 1 instance of damage instead of several ticks. , if a multiplier snapshots to an Earthquake for its regular tick damage when that Earthquake is created, it will also be active for the detonation.

The total tick damage of an Earthquake and a detonation is simply written as: which is roughly the same amount when we account for the number of EQ ticks only going up by 1 every step of 12.5% duration, by comparison the explosion damage scales continously with more duration. Each Earthquake tick has a separate roll to cause a Critical Strike on each individual enemy hit, where as an Earthquake detonation just rolls a Critical Strike on each individual enemy hit as it's 1 instance of damage instead of several ticks. , if a multiplier snapshots to an Earthquake for its regular tick damage when that Earthquake is created, it will also be active for the detonation.

The Weapon Expertise system grant various effects when you're different weapons for your skill casts. is in bold because it's key to kind of understand what the Weapon Expertise system works or doesn't work with. Let's start with how the Weapon Expertise system works. The basic idea is that when you cast a skill that can have weapons assigned to it, also called an Arsenal Selection (Dual Wield, Bludgeoning or Slicing), that skill gains a bonus depending on the Arsenal Selection that you've made, i.e you're a weapon when casting a skill. However if you're casting a skill that can not have a weapon selection assigned to it, you will not gain any additional effects for that skill cast because you're not a weapon for its cast. This difference can be seen with the tooltips below, where requires that an Arsenal Selection is assigned to it while does not have such a requirement. This means that if you cast while dual wielding 1-hand Maces, that cast will not gain 20% increased damage against enemies, while the cast will gain that bonus. Let's take a closer look at what the Weapon Expertise system does not work with. As mentioned above, any skill that does not have an Arsenal Selection will not gain any Weapon Expertise effects when it's cast, however there are a few more cases to be aware of: Let's talk through them. has several bugs associated with it being a new skill for Vessel of Hatred, and one of those bugs happens to be that it's not behaving properly with the Weapon Expertise system. Earthquakes and Dust Devils are weird because sometimes they are and sometimes they aren't considered a skill, and in this context spawning an Earthquake or a Dust Devil is considered casting a skill that can not have a weapon assigned to its cast, hence whenever one is spawned the game thought that you just used a skill without using a weapon for it, which means the entire Weapon Expertise system simply turns off. From testing we see that Weapon Expertise effects (in this case increased damage while ) disappear from the statsheet whenever a Lucky Hit direct damage proc from items occur. This means that the Weapon Expertise system sees these procs as casting a separate skill that deals damage without having a weapon assigned to it, and thus turns off when a damage proc happens. Do note that procs from does not show this behaviour, which is where the direct damage condition comes from. buff turning off Weapon Expertise effects is slightly baffling, however several tests have shown the effects turning off whenever the buff is gained/refreshed, meaning the Weapon Expertise system must see the buff as a separate skill cast that does not have an Arsenal Selection. Currently the Weapon Expertise effects behave differently depending on what weapon arsenal you're using for different damage types. The table below lists whether these Weapon Expertise effects: For example in the table we see that the increased damage against enemies has the following properties: with Direct hits simply means that even if does not gain any Weapon Expertise effects on its cast, you can swap to a Polearm immediately after casting and still gain the 15%[x] increased damage while effect for the pulses and even the initial hit if you have enough Attack Speed. We can also imagine the following example to show the One last thing to mention on the general Weapon Expertise topic. When you are wielding a weapon and also have that weapons bonus selected in the Technique slot, the first part of the Weapon Expertise effect (in this case 20%[x] increased damage against enemies with ) is added together with the bonus you get from simply using a weapon during and after a skill cast. So if you are wielding two 1-Handed Maces and also have that effect in the Technique slot you will deal 40%[x] increased damage against enemies when that effect is applicable. Same for goes e.g. - two instances of 10%[x] increased damage against enemies becomes 20%[x], and 15%[x] increased Lucky Hit with become 30%[x] increased Lucky Hit (note that this is a separate multiplier from Lucky Hit on gear). is part of the Weapon Expertise system that's available to Barbarians. It's made up of two parts: The technique part which is the same-ish effect as can be equipped at any time regardless of which weapon you're currently using, while the usage part which increases your damage after killing enemies only is active while you're using (holding in your hands) a 2-Handed Sword. The technique part is what's most commonly referred to when talking about , and we'll be doing the same going forward. Mechanically there's not much difference between , they both convert some percentage of the direct hits base damage to a on the target, however is limited to the following compared to Some notable examples to show this difference: The following interactions have been verified through damage recording or footage to ensure they are not functional.

The Weapon Expertise system grant various effects when you're different weapons for your skill casts. is in bold because it's key to kind of understand what the Weapon Expertise system works or doesn't work with. Let's start with how the Weapon Expertise system works. The basic idea is that when you cast a skill that can have weapons assigned to it, also called an Arsenal Selection (Dual Wield, Bludgeoning or Slicing), that skill gains a bonus depending on the Arsenal Selection that you've made, i.e you're a weapon when casting a skill. However if you're casting a skill that can not have a weapon selection assigned to it, you will not gain any additional effects for that skill cast because you're not a weapon for its cast. This difference can be seen with the tooltips below, where requires that an Arsenal Selection is assigned to it while does not have such a requirement. This means that if you cast while dual wielding 1-hand Maces, that cast will not gain 20% increased damage against enemies, while the cast will gain that bonus. Let's take a closer look at what the Weapon Expertise system does not work with. As mentioned above, any skill that does not have an Arsenal Selection will not gain any Weapon Expertise effects when it's cast, however there are a few more cases to be aware of: Let's talk through them. has several bugs associated with it being a new skill for Vessel of Hatred, and one of those bugs happens to be that it's not behaving properly with the Weapon Expertise system. Earthquakes and Dust Devils are weird because sometimes they are and sometimes they aren't considered a skill, and in this context spawning an Earthquake or a Dust Devil is considered casting a skill that can not have a weapon assigned to its cast, hence whenever one is spawned the game thought that you just used a skill without using a weapon for it, which means the entire Weapon Expertise system simply turns off. From testing we see that Weapon Expertise effects (in this case increased damage while ) disappear from the statsheet whenever a Lucky Hit direct damage proc from items occur. This means that the Weapon Expertise system sees these procs as casting a separate skill that deals damage without having a weapon assigned to it, and thus turns off when a damage proc happens. Do note that procs from does not show this behaviour, which is where the direct damage condition comes from. buff turning off Weapon Expertise effects is slightly baffling, however several tests have shown the effects turning off whenever the buff is gained/refreshed, meaning the Weapon Expertise system must see the buff as a separate skill cast that does not have an Arsenal Selection. Currently the Weapon Expertise effects behave differently depending on what weapon arsenal you're using for different damage types. The table below lists whether these Weapon Expertise effects: For example in the table we see that the increased damage against enemies has the following properties: with Direct hits simply means that even if does not gain any Weapon Expertise effects on its cast, you can swap to a Polearm immediately after casting and still gain the 15%[x] increased damage while effect for the pulses and even the initial hit if you have enough Attack Speed. We can also imagine the following example to show the One last thing to mention on the general Weapon Expertise topic. When you are wielding a weapon and also have that weapons bonus selected in the Technique slot, the first part of the Weapon Expertise effect (in this case 20%[x] increased damage against enemies with ) is added together with the bonus you get from simply using a weapon during and after a skill cast. So if you are wielding two 1-Handed Maces and also have that effect in the Technique slot you will deal 40%[x] increased damage against enemies when that effect is applicable. Same for goes e.g. - two instances of 10%[x] increased damage against enemies becomes 20%[x], and 15%[x] increased Lucky Hit with become 30%[x] increased Lucky Hit (note that this is a separate multiplier from Lucky Hit on gear). is part of the Weapon Expertise system that's available to Barbarians. It's made up of two parts: The technique part which is the same-ish effect as can be equipped at any time regardless of which weapon you're currently using, while the usage part which increases your damage after killing enemies only is active while you're using (holding in your hands) a 2-Handed Sword.

The Weapon Expertise system grant various effects when you're different weapons for your skill casts. is in bold because it's key to kind of understand what the Weapon Expertise system works or doesn't work with. Let's start with how the Weapon Expertise system works. The basic idea is that when you cast a skill that can have weapons assigned to it, also called an Arsenal Selection (Dual Wield, Bludgeoning or Slicing), that skill gains a bonus depending on the Arsenal Selection that you've made, i.e you're a weapon when casting a skill. However if you're casting a skill that can not have a weapon selection assigned to it, you will not gain any additional effects for that skill cast because you're not a weapon for its cast. This difference can be seen with the tooltips below, where requires that an Arsenal Selection is assigned to it while does not have such a requirement. This means that if you cast while dual wielding 1-hand Maces, that cast will not gain 20% increased damage against enemies, while the cast will gain that bonus. Let's take a closer look at what the Weapon Expertise system does not work with. As mentioned above, any skill that does not have an Arsenal Selection will not gain any Weapon Expertise effects when it's cast, however there are a few more cases to be aware of: Let's talk through them. has several bugs associated with it being a new skill for Vessel of Hatred, and one of those bugs happens to be that it's not behaving properly with the Weapon Expertise system. Earthquakes and Dust Devils are weird because sometimes they are and sometimes they aren't considered a skill, and in this context spawning an Earthquake or a Dust Devil is considered casting a skill that can not have a weapon assigned to its cast, hence whenever one is spawned the game thought that you just used a skill without using a weapon for it, which means the entire Weapon Expertise system simply turns off. From testing we see that Weapon Expertise effects (in this case increased damage while ) disappear from the statsheet whenever a Lucky Hit direct damage proc from items occur. This means that the Weapon Expertise system sees these procs as casting a separate skill that deals damage without having a weapon assigned to it, and thus turns off when a damage proc happens. Do note that procs from does not show this behaviour, which is where the direct damage condition comes from. buff turning off Weapon Expertise effects is slightly baffling, however several tests have shown the effects turning off whenever the buff is gained/refreshed, meaning the Weapon Expertise system must see the buff as a separate skill cast that does not have an Arsenal Selection. Currently the Weapon Expertise effects behave differently depending on what weapon arsenal you're using for different damage types. The table below lists whether these Weapon Expertise effects: For example in the table we see that the increased damage against enemies has the following properties: with Direct hits simply means that even if does not gain any Weapon Expertise effects on its cast, you can swap to a Polearm immediately after casting and still gain the 15%[x] increased damage while effect for the pulses and even the initial hit if you have enough Attack Speed. We can also imagine the following example to show the One last thing to mention on the general Weapon Expertise topic. When you are wielding a weapon and also have that weapons bonus selected in the Technique slot, the first part of the Weapon Expertise effect (in this case 20%[x] increased damage against enemies with ) is added together with the bonus you get from simply using a weapon during and after a skill cast. So if you are wielding two 1-Handed Maces and also have that effect in the Technique slot you will deal 40%[x] increased damage against enemies when that effect is applicable. Same for goes e.g. - two instances of 10%[x] increased damage against enemies becomes 20%[x], and 15%[x] increased Lucky Hit with become 30%[x] increased Lucky Hit (note that this is a separate multiplier from Lucky Hit on gear). is part of the Weapon Expertise system that's available to Barbarians. It's made up of two parts: The technique part which is the same-ish effect as can be equipped at any time regardless of which weapon you're currently using, while the usage part which increases your damage after killing enemies only is active while you're using (holding in your hands) a 2-Handed Sword. The technique part is what's most commonly referred to when talking about , and we'll be doing the same going forward.

When an Earthquake is created the affix rolls a die, and if successful that Earthquake will deal double damage for all of its damage ticks and a subsequent explosion if detonated via the Unique effect. . The explosion damage is based off of the total damage an earthquake would deal over it's duration. So if we were to write out the damage an Earthquake would deal per tick it would look like: is from Earthquakes having a bug that makes them deal double damage compared to their tooltip values, and the represents the damage of 1 tick (4s duration with a tick every 0.5s). The total tick damage of an Earthquake and a detonation is simply written as: which is roughly the same amount when we account for the number of EQ ticks only going up by 1 every step of 12.5% duration, by comparison the explosion damage scales continously with more duration. Each Earthquake tick has a separate roll to cause a Critical Strike on each individual enemy hit, where as an Earthquake detonation just rolls a Critical Strike on each individual enemy hit as it's 1 instance of damage instead of several ticks. , if a multiplier snapshots to an Earthquake for its regular tick damage when that Earthquake is created, it will also be active for the detonation.

The Weapon Expertise system grant various effects when you're different weapons for your skill casts. is in bold because it's key to kind of understand what the Weapon Expertise system works or doesn't work with. Let's start with how the Weapon Expertise system works. The basic idea is that when you cast a skill that can have weapons assigned to it, also called an Arsenal Selection (Dual Wield, Bludgeoning or Slicing), that skill gains a bonus depending on the Arsenal Selection that you've made, i.e you're a weapon when casting a skill. However if you're casting a skill that can not have a weapon selection assigned to it, you will not gain any additional effects for that skill cast because you're not a weapon for its cast. This difference can be seen with the tooltips below, where requires that an Arsenal Selection is assigned to it while does not have such a requirement. This means that if you cast while dual wielding 1-hand Maces, that cast will not gain 20% increased damage against enemies, while the cast will gain that bonus. Let's take a closer look at what the Weapon Expertise system does not work with. As mentioned above, any skill that does not have an Arsenal Selection will not gain any Weapon Expertise effects when it's cast, however there are a few more cases to be aware of: Let's talk through them. has several bugs associated with it being a new skill for Vessel of Hatred, and one of those bugs happens to be that it's not behaving properly with the Weapon Expertise system. Earthquakes and Dust Devils are weird because sometimes they are and sometimes they aren't considered a skill, and in this context spawning an Earthquake or a Dust Devil is considered casting a skill that can not have a weapon assigned to its cast, hence whenever one is spawned the game thought that you just used a skill without using a weapon for it, which means the entire Weapon Expertise system simply turns off. From testing we see that Weapon Expertise effects (in this case increased damage while ) disappear from the statsheet whenever a Lucky Hit direct damage proc from items occur. This means that the Weapon Expertise system sees these procs as casting a separate skill that deals damage without having a weapon assigned to it, and thus turns off when a damage proc happens. Do note that procs from does not show this behaviour, which is where the direct damage condition comes from. buff turning off Weapon Expertise effects is slightly baffling, however several tests have shown the effects turning off whenever the buff is gained/refreshed, meaning the Weapon Expertise system must see the buff as a separate skill cast that does not have an Arsenal Selection. Currently the Weapon Expertise effects behave differently depending on what weapon arsenal you're using for different damage types. The table below lists whether these Weapon Expertise effects: For example in the table we see that the increased damage against enemies has the following properties: with Direct hits simply means that even if does not gain any Weapon Expertise effects on its cast, you can swap to a Polearm immediately after casting and still gain the 15%[x] increased damage while effect for the pulses and even the initial hit if you have enough Attack Speed. We can also imagine the following example to show the One last thing to mention on the general Weapon Expertise topic. When you are wielding a weapon and also have that weapons bonus selected in the Technique slot, the first part of the Weapon Expertise effect (in this case 20%[x] increased damage against enemies with ) is added together with the bonus you get from simply using a weapon during and after a skill cast. So if you are wielding two 1-Handed Maces and also have that effect in the Technique slot you will deal 40%[x] increased damage against enemies when that effect is applicable. Same for goes e.g. - two instances of 10%[x] increased damage against enemies becomes 20%[x], and 15%[x] increased Lucky Hit with become 30%[x] increased Lucky Hit (note that this is a separate multiplier from Lucky Hit on gear). is part of the Weapon Expertise system that's available to Barbarians. It's made up of two parts: The technique part which is the same-ish effect as can be equipped at any time regardless of which weapon you're currently using, while the usage part which increases your damage after killing enemies only is active while you're using (holding in your hands) a 2-Handed Sword.

The Weapon Expertise system grant various effects when you're different weapons for your skill casts. is in bold because it's key to kind of understand what the Weapon Expertise system works or doesn't work with. Let's start with how the Weapon Expertise system works. The basic idea is that when you cast a skill that can have weapons assigned to it, also called an Arsenal Selection (Dual Wield, Bludgeoning or Slicing), that skill gains a bonus depending on the Arsenal Selection that you've made, i.e you're a weapon when casting a skill. However if you're casting a skill that can not have a weapon selection assigned to it, you will not gain any additional effects for that skill cast because you're not a weapon for its cast. This difference can be seen with the tooltips below, where requires that an Arsenal Selection is assigned to it while does not have such a requirement. This means that if you cast while dual wielding 1-hand Maces, that cast will not gain 20% increased damage against enemies, while the cast will gain that bonus. Let's take a closer look at what the Weapon Expertise system does not work with. As mentioned above, any skill that does not have an Arsenal Selection will not gain any Weapon Expertise effects when it's cast, however there are a few more cases to be aware of: Let's talk through them. has several bugs associated with it being a new skill for Vessel of Hatred, and one of those bugs happens to be that it's not behaving properly with the Weapon Expertise system. Earthquakes and Dust Devils are weird because sometimes they are and sometimes they aren't considered a skill, and in this context spawning an Earthquake or a Dust Devil is considered casting a skill that can not have a weapon assigned to its cast, hence whenever one is spawned the game thought that you just used a skill without using a weapon for it, which means the entire Weapon Expertise system simply turns off. From testing we see that Weapon Expertise effects (in this case increased damage while ) disappear from the statsheet whenever a Lucky Hit direct damage proc from items occur. This means that the Weapon Expertise system sees these procs as casting a separate skill that deals damage without having a weapon assigned to it, and thus turns off when a damage proc happens. Do note that procs from does not show this behaviour, which is where the direct damage condition comes from. buff turning off Weapon Expertise effects is slightly baffling, however several tests have shown the effects turning off whenever the buff is gained/refreshed, meaning the Weapon Expertise system must see the buff as a separate skill cast that does not have an Arsenal Selection. Currently the Weapon Expertise effects behave differently depending on what weapon arsenal you're using for different damage types. The table below lists whether these Weapon Expertise effects: For example in the table we see that the increased damage against enemies has the following properties: with Direct hits simply means that even if does not gain any Weapon Expertise effects on its cast, you can swap to a Polearm immediately after casting and still gain the 15%[x] increased damage while effect for the pulses and even the initial hit if you have enough Attack Speed. We can also imagine the following example to show the One last thing to mention on the general Weapon Expertise topic. When you are wielding a weapon and also have that weapons bonus selected in the Technique slot, the first part of the Weapon Expertise effect (in this case 20%[x] increased damage against enemies with ) is added together with the bonus you get from simply using a weapon during and after a skill cast. So if you are wielding two 1-Handed Maces and also have that effect in the Technique slot you will deal 40%[x] increased damage against enemies when that effect is applicable. Same for goes e.g. - two instances of 10%[x] increased damage against enemies becomes 20%[x], and 15%[x] increased Lucky Hit with become 30%[x] increased Lucky Hit (note that this is a separate multiplier from Lucky Hit on gear). is part of the Weapon Expertise system that's available to Barbarians. It's made up of two parts: The technique part which is the same-ish effect as can be equipped at any time regardless of which weapon you're currently using, while the usage part which increases your damage after killing enemies only is active while you're using (holding in your hands) a 2-Handed Sword. The technique part is what's most commonly referred to when talking about , and we'll be doing the same going forward.

When an Earthquake is created the affix rolls a die, and if successful that Earthquake will deal double damage for all of its damage ticks and a subsequent explosion if detonated via the Unique effect. . The explosion damage is based off of the total damage an earthquake would deal over it's duration. So if we were to write out the damage an Earthquake would deal per tick it would look like: is from Earthquakes having a bug that makes them deal double damage compared to their tooltip values, and the represents the damage of 1 tick (4s duration with a tick every 0.5s). The total tick damage of an Earthquake and a detonation is simply written as: which is roughly the same amount when we account for the number of EQ ticks only going up by 1 every step of 12.5% duration, by comparison the explosion damage scales continously with more duration. Each Earthquake tick has a separate roll to cause a Critical Strike on each individual enemy hit, where as an Earthquake detonation just rolls a Critical Strike on each individual enemy hit as it's 1 instance of damage instead of several ticks. , if a multiplier snapshots to an Earthquake for its regular tick damage when that Earthquake is created, it will also be active for the detonation.

The Weapon Expertise system grant various effects when you're different weapons for your skill casts. is in bold because it's key to kind of understand what the Weapon Expertise system works or doesn't work with. Let's start with how the Weapon Expertise system works. The basic idea is that when you cast a skill that can have weapons assigned to it, also called an Arsenal Selection (Dual Wield, Bludgeoning or Slicing), that skill gains a bonus depending on the Arsenal Selection that you've made, i.e you're a weapon when casting a skill. However if you're casting a skill that can not have a weapon selection assigned to it, you will not gain any additional effects for that skill cast because you're not a weapon for its cast. This difference can be seen with the tooltips below, where requires that an Arsenal Selection is assigned to it while does not have such a requirement. This means that if you cast while dual wielding 1-hand Maces, that cast will not gain 20% increased damage against enemies, while the cast will gain that bonus. Let's take a closer look at what the Weapon Expertise system does not work with. As mentioned above, any skill that does not have an Arsenal Selection will not gain any Weapon Expertise effects when it's cast, however there are a few more cases to be aware of: Let's talk through them. has several bugs associated with it being a new skill for Vessel of Hatred, and one of those bugs happens to be that it's not behaving properly with the Weapon Expertise system. Earthquakes and Dust Devils are weird because sometimes they are and sometimes they aren't considered a skill, and in this context spawning an Earthquake or a Dust Devil is considered casting a skill that can not have a weapon assigned to its cast, hence whenever one is spawned the game thought that you just used a skill without using a weapon for it, which means the entire Weapon Expertise system simply turns off. From testing we see that Weapon Expertise effects (in this case increased damage while ) disappear from the statsheet whenever a Lucky Hit direct damage proc from items occur. This means that the Weapon Expertise system sees these procs as casting a separate skill that deals damage without having a weapon assigned to it, and thus turns off when a damage proc happens. Do note that procs from does not show this behaviour, which is where the direct damage condition comes from. buff turning off Weapon Expertise effects is slightly baffling, however several tests have shown the effects turning off whenever the buff is gained/refreshed, meaning the Weapon Expertise system must see the buff as a separate skill cast that does not have an Arsenal Selection. Currently the Weapon Expertise effects behave differently depending on what weapon arsenal you're using for different damage types. The table below lists whether these Weapon Expertise effects: For example in the table we see that the increased damage against enemies has the following properties: with Direct hits simply means that even if does not gain any Weapon Expertise effects on its cast, you can swap to a Polearm immediately after casting and still gain the 15%[x] increased damage while effect for the pulses and even the initial hit if you have enough Attack Speed. We can also imagine the following example to show the One last thing to mention on the general Weapon Expertise topic. When you are wielding a weapon and also have that weapons bonus selected in the Technique slot, the first part of the Weapon Expertise effect (in this case 20%[x] increased damage against enemies with ) is added together with the bonus you get from simply using a weapon during and after a skill cast.

The table below lists whether these Weapon Expertise effects: For example in the table we see that the increased damage against enemies has the following properties: with Direct hits simply means that even if does not gain any Weapon Expertise effects on its cast, you can swap to a Polearm immediately after casting and still gain the 15%[x] increased damage while effect for the pulses and even the initial hit if you have enough Attack Speed. We can also imagine the following example to show the One last thing to mention on the general Weapon Expertise topic. When you are wielding a weapon and also have that weapons bonus selected in the Technique slot, the first part of the Weapon Expertise effect (in this case 20%[x] increased damage against enemies with ) is added together with the bonus you get from simply using a weapon during and after a skill cast.
