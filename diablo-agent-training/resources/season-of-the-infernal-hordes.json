    "content": "Diablo 4 strikes again with season 5 : ! Seasons within Diablo IV bear their mark on Sanctuary in the Seasonal Realm similarly to late , unearthing new quests and fresh mechanics to explore and master. Discover another chapter of what Lilith’s return to Sanctuary has wrought on the land. Create unlikely alliances and discover what imminent threat the Realm of Hatred poses to Sanctuary. On both Seasonal and Eternal Realms, beat back Hell’s legions in the Infernal Hordes, a wave-based feature that pits you against seemingly endless monsters. Read on for everything you need to know to descend into Hell and fight against the legions that await you. Available on both Seasonal and Eternal realms starting in World Tier III after completing a Questline, the Infernal Hordes is a wave-based feature that you can slay through solo or with friends. Select tempting Infernal Offerings—a boon and a bane to augment your run—between waves to optionally increase your enemy’s potency and final rewards. Legions of Infernal demons are densely packed, their numbers increasing in size within the Realm of Hatred. You’ll have limited revives to see your way through the Infernal Hordes, lose all of them and you will be consumed by Hell’s minions. Throughout the Infernal Hordes, collect Burning Aether to use at the end of your run to unlock bountiful rewards. Upon completing the final wave, rage against the Fell Council—formidable corrupted Priests each with unique attacks. Finally, use your Burning Aether to unlock tantalizing Spoils of Hell that grant you summoning materials, items with a guaranteed Greater Affix, and a chance at earning the new Uniques and Legendaries. Hell breeds fierce opponents, Aether Fiends lurk in every corner to stymy your valiant efforts. Fear Aether Lords who may arrive within the Infernal Hordes and burn with a determination yet unseen. Cries of fresh meat seep with increased terror—a hellish variant of The Butcher has a chance to appear and sow destruction. Earn or craft Infernal Compasses to access the Infernal Hordes, which drop from various end-game content throughout Sanctuary. Infernal Compasses scale by Tier to increase relative intensity within the Infernal Hordes. The Infernal Hordes have time-limited 60 second waves—manage to survive and you’ll be taunted with an Infernal Offer. These temptations give you the choice between three different Boons and Banes to augment the Infernal Hordes and crank up the intensity, making your run far more challenging (and rewarding) if you can withstand the difficulty. Be warned and choose wisely—Infernal Offers will stack across the duration of your Infernal Hordes run. Many will be active at the same time! These nuanced boons and banes will even apply to your showdown with the Fell Council—their potency could be your undoing… or your immense profit. While masses of infernal enemies attempt to crush you at every angle, look for Burning Aether, your most precious commodity in the Realm of Hatred. Earn Burning Aether by slaying Aether Fiends and Aether Lords or by smashing Soulspires and Aetheric Masses. Destroying any of these provides 2 Burning Aether for your efforts. Burning Aether is earned individually, regardless of playing solo or in a group, however your trusted Pet will aid you in collecting these.

The key to unlocking the Infernal Hordes lies in Infernal Compasses, dark devices of occult knowledge that open the very gates of Hell itself. These fiendish keys scale from Tier 1-8 and can be crafted at the Occultist with Sigil Power and Forgotten Souls. Infernal Compass Tiers increase the starting difficulty of monsters and the potency of your rewards, while decreasing your number of revives. Earn Infernal Compasses by opening Chests of Mystery, Chests of Steel, and slaying Doomsayers in Helltides where they are guaranteed to drop. These also have a 75% chance to drop from Whisper Caches.

Every time you face the Fell Council, 3 different members will be selected at random to fight you. Be wary of their unique abilities in the various combinations you’ll encounter them.
