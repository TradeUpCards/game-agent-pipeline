They use overwhelming strength and a mastery of weapons to turn battlefields into wastelands. This overview covers their Strengths & Weaknesses, Skills, Passives, , and much more. Let's jump in and learn about the true god of weapons! The Barbarian has unparalleled strength and expertly wields multiple weapons during battle. He bellows intimidating war cries and unleashes ground-shaking slams to send approaching hordes reeling. Barbarians are fun to play with fast-paced action and many customization options. Their skills are fueled by , a resource that generates while in battle and depletes slowly outside of it. All Barbarian skills deal damage by default. The four core attributes provide the following to the Barbarian: Strength is considered the main attribute as it multiplies all of your skill damage. Dexterity and Willpower are also useful for their offensive and defensive bonuses, while Intelligence improves magical resistances. Some items can roll bonuses to attributes, and later on, Paragon boards allow stacking the right stats for your character. In addition, you may find hidden in the open world that unlock a permanent bonus for all of your characters. The Barbarian has the unique ability to equip FOUR WEAPONS at the same time: They can swap between them depending on the ability used, and the Barbarian's lets you choose which Weapon applies to each ability. The rolled affixes of each Weapon always apply to your damage, however, the raw Damage per Second (DPS) of a skill is determined only by the attacking Weapon in the . In other words, your main weapon does your damage, and the others are \"stat sticks\". There is one final advantage to holding this many items: more ! These extra powers are very useful and give the Barbarian a notable advantage. Chest Armor Two-Handed Mace Two-Handed Sword, Axe, and Polearm One-Handed Axe, Sword, and Mace (x2) Skill points are unlocked by level-ups and the . As you spend more points, you unlock multiple categories of skills.

After unlocking a skill, you can enhance it with another point and then choose one out of two upgrades to specialize it even further. In addition, there are passives found all over the tree, attached as optional choices to certain skill clusters. They grant small bonuses to damage, defense or utility under certain conditions and help to round out your build by shifting it further in the direction you want to take. All passives have 3 ranks and usually scale linearly. Basic skills are weak and are used to generate and apply debuffs like When you run out of resources, they are useful to finish off small enemies or to add extra damage against an Elite or Boss while you prepare one of your stronger -spending attacks. Flay has a relatively high potential damage per hit compared to other basic skills. However, like all skills, that potential is only realized if the DoT ticks for its entire duration. This ability also gives a respectable Damage Reduction bonus, or increases total damage. Because of that, it's best when facing a boss with a Lunging Strike gives great mobility, has a large damage bonus against healthy enemies, heals you, and either triggers Berserking or adds a large bleed. On top of that, this skill can deal more damage out of all the basic skills. It's easy to see why this is the most popular basic skill for Barbarians. Frenzy is typically taken for its high Damage Reduction. It is the only basic skill with a dedicated item, which makes it quite popular in the endgame for players fortunate enough to find Bash is the most under-appreciated basic skill. It should scale well in the endgame: with enough attack speed, it can stunlock opponents. It quickly generates , which can be a life-saver. Finally, it can guarantee an , which could give Barbarians the crazy damage numbers they need to annihilate endgame bosses. These skills are the primary damage dealers of most Barbarian builds. They spend lots of but deal much higher damage and hit more targets than . In addition, can be amplified by multiple These skills significantly boost your defensive capabilities. Many of them also allow you to control enemies and increase your Thorns damage. This cluster of skills adds various utility choices to your setup. Generally, you want to choose one of these depending on your build and play style to assist you either offensively, defensively, or both. These skills allow you to master your Weapons, dealing significant damage with cooldown-based attacks.

These passives are located at the very bottom of the Skill Tree and couldn't be reached in the preview version. They are extremely powerful and define the overall playstyle of your build.

And yes, you can keep that bonus up indefinitely. This key passive is significantly more difficult to make good use of compared to . You will need to design a build around the expectation that you'll use 3 different weapons, each at least once every 10 seconds. The damage bonus is significant, and the attack speed bonus feels great too. However, having 3 offensive abilities means you're pulling in multiple directions at once, and it's difficult to optimize a build around those competing interests. This skill feels like cheating once you can actually afford it. At first, spending extra to deal extra damage is a fair trade - but in the endgame, it's a win-win! Barbarians are rewarded in numerous ways for spending quickly, and there's plenty to go around when you prioritize Resource Generation on your gear. This is considered by many to be the best key passive for any endgame build that relies on core skills for their damage - even Out of all of the Key Passive skills available to Barbarians, this one is the most challenging to make good use of. Other key passives will yield better damage bonuses unless you have a build designed around maximizing your Critical Strike Chance and Critical Strike Damage bonuses, including perfectly rolled gear and - one of the rarest weapons in the game. For those who enjoy builds and are ready to commit to making this work, there's no greater achievement than making This Key Passive focuses on turning your passive Thorns damage into a more active playstyle by making you pulsate Thorns damage every second to enemies around you. The Arsenal System allows Barbarians to wield 4 weapons and assign different weapons to each of their attacks. Each weapon gives a different Expertise bonus to the Barbarian's attacks. In addition, the Technique Slot is unlocked via a quest chain at level 15. In addition to getting the Weapon Expertise bonus for the weapon they are currently using, Barbarians also get the benefit of the Weapon Expertise they have assigned to their Technique Slot, regardless of what weapon they are using. Note that the Technique slot only gives the first part of Expertise, not the bonus. The Weapon Expertise and the Weapon Technique stack, so it's okay (and sometimes optimal) to assign a weapon currently in use to the Technique slot.

Return to town and you're done! The first order of business is to assign the weapon for your main damage ability. Do this by opening the Skill Assignment menu through the Skill Tree, hovering over the skill on the skill bar that you want to assign a weapon to, and selecting Cycle Weapons. This will cycle the skill's Arsenal Selection between Auto-Select, Dual Wield, Bludgeoning, and Slashing.

In some cases, the weapon type and its Weapon Expertise bonus can have a big impact on the skill's damage and its utility. Some of your weapons may not have a high DPS and/or may not have very valuable Weapon Expertise bonuses, and you may not assign them to any skills. You can think of these weapons as \"stat-sticks.\" They contribute valuable affixes to your character's stats, but since they are never actually wielded when performing attacks, their DPS and their Weapon Expertise bonuses do not matter. Leveling up the Arsenal System is a natural process that begins at level 15. As you pick up new weapons and battle monsters, the corresponding weapons you're using gain experience.
