    "content": "The Renown system is a critical part of the progression for all Characters in Diablo 4. It serves as your reputation within the different Sanctuary Zones and is split into 5 stages. It grants Gold, additional Skill Points, Potion Charges, Murmuring Obol capacity increases, and Paragon Points. Renown is account-wide and the benefits are permanent, so once you complete all five levels, you do not have to do it again. But doing it that first time is crucial! Each main Zone has its own Renown counter. At certain thresholds, the points you have collected unlock rewards. The stages are split up into 5 sections, which are split into account-wide and individual character rewards. To unlock the final 2 stages, you need to reach level 60. With all Renown boards completed, all characters on your account receive 12 Skill Points, 6 Potion Charges, 480 Obol capacity, and 24 extra Paragon Points. Each stage requires a certain amount of Renown points to be unlocked. Each character starts at 0 points in all zones. These stages can easily be reached without completing every single objective in a zone. Each zone has more than enough objectives to complete all 5 stages of its board without completing every single one. In this table you see the available Renown Points in each zone."
