    "content": "Earning experience and leveling up your character is at the heart of every RPG. If you want to reach level 60 and a high Paragon level for your Endgame build efficiently, understanding the gameâ€™s underlying experience mechanics is essential. In this post, we explain how the different experience bonuses found throughout the game come together and how monster XP scaling works. Let's walk you through it! If you change zones while under the effect of incense, they stop granting a bonus to XP gained. As a baseline, XP earned from monster kills follows the following set of rules: The XP value of Elites is significant compared to regular monsters, given that you can defeat them at a comparable pace.  To give some examples in the Pit, where the data can reliably be collected: This means that a non-Elite Outlaw gives exactly 10% of the experience of an Elite, while a non-Elite Deckhand gives 14% of the experience of an Elite. The exact formulas for each Monster Family have not been extracted, but the formulas mentioned above give us a good idea of the intended design. Previously, the enemy level scaled the experience gained, but as of Vessel of Hatred, enemies are the same level as you. Outside of being carried in high levels of the Pit, there are several ways to improve XP gains. The most basic is increasing the difficulty you're playing on: This scaling is what the Pit uses to determine your monster kill XP gain as well. Going from Pit 25 to 35 is a 25% increase in XP, and going from Torment 1 to Torment 2 is also a 25% increase (300% increased XP to 400% increased XP is a 25% increase). The rate of XP you gain in different content is based on how mobile the build you are running is. Using a melee build for Rogue, the following rough estimates were acquired to compare the rate of XP you gain doing different content in Diablo 4. These XP gains assume you are clearing a Pit dungeon in roughly 1 minute and 30 seconds. If you aim to farm XP as fast as possible, you should clear the Pit as fast as possible. The other content offers a decent amount of XP, but not nearly as much as the Pit. However, during events such as Mother's Blessing and the Lunar Festival, the bridge between the Pit, Infernal Hordes, and Nightmare Dungeons shrinks as a larger portion of the XP rewarded from that content is rewarded from monster kills. In addition to raising the difficulty, you can also boost XP in the following ways: Campfires are a special source of experience bonuses found in the open world. They appear at zone event sites such as the event when the event is loading up (marked on the map). If you get there early and stand next to an active fire, you can stack up the campfire buff for a total of 15% bonus XP over the course of two minutes. However, each stack of the buff only lasts for a short time and vanishes when you leave the area, so it is just a very minor bonus.
