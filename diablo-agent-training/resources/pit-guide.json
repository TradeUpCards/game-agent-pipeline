It is intended to be the most difficult content in the game, scaling up to Tier 150. It has a level requirement of level 60, and you should be equipped with a well-optimized build as you dive deeper into the Pit of Artificers. The Pit of Artificers is available after reaching level 60 in . You can acquire by completing different Endgame activities. You can consume these at the Obelisk in to open the portal to The Pit of Artificers. In the Pit of Artificers, you need to slay enough monsters before the 15-minute timer runs out to summon a final boss. Each player's death removes time from the clock. The first death removes 30 seconds, the second death removes 60 seconds, and the third and subsequent deaths will remove 90 seconds. After you defeat enough monsters, a portal materializes, transporting you to the boss arena. Enter the portal and slay the boss before the timer expires to upgrade your powerful glyphs. Consequently, this also unlocks the next brutal tier(s) of The Pit of Artificers. You are rewarded with additional Tier unlocks depending on how much time you have left after killing the boss. The Pit has 150 total difficulty levels to try and conquer if you dare face the challenge. After completing a Tier, you unlock the next Tier along with rewards which we touch on in the next section. Players who manage to clear the entire pit and slay the boss before the timer runs out can upgrade their . If you successfully clear the pit, you gain: Depending on the difficulty of the pit, the odds of successfully upgrading your glyph increase based on the level difference between the glyph and the pit run. If the difference between your glyph and the Pit level is greater than 20, your glyph gets an additional upgrade. The max level of glyphs has been increased from level 21 to level 100, with a new Legendary upgrade at level 46 giving it an additional radius size and a new affix. In addition, glyphs you have not yet found in other places can now drop at the end of the pit run. At the end of every Pit Run is a Boss. The toughest and most time-consuming part of the run, which boss you encounter, will heavily influence how long the fight takes. Additionally, once you hit a high tier in the Pit, there are Echoes of the major bosses, such as Lilith. These Echoes have significant background effects mimicking their attacks from their own fight. For example, Echos of Lilith can cause the spikes on the ground to appear and potentially damage you. As of Season 8, Pit Bosses no longer apply the Tormented debuff when you take damage, which used to cause you to take more damage. There are at least 11 different bosses, each with their unique attacks. Some bosses have more HP than others, and some have annoying mechanics that can ruin a pit push, so when you're farming, figure out what bosses feel best for your build and which ones feel easy or difficult. The Echoes are triggered by the boss reaching certain HP breakpoints, and there are up to three different ones during each boss fight. The boss has the first one from the start, the second unlocks after the boss reaches 75% HP, while the third Echo is always the Echo of Lilith and happens at 50% remaining HP. These boss echoes are invulnerable and lurk in the background, but there are cues to their attacks, so pay attention! The Echo attacks can come in a variety of forms, depending on the echo that shows up. Elias's Echo attacks can include targeted fireballs or cones of fire. Lilith's Echo mimics attacks from her Pinnacle challenge, including the spikes in the floor and the wave patterns. Keep an eye out - dodge like your life depends on it because it does!

If the difference between your glyph and the Pit level is greater than 20, your glyph gets an additional upgrade. The max level of glyphs has been increased from level 21 to level 100, with a new Legendary upgrade at level 46 giving it an additional radius size and a new affix. In addition, glyphs you have not yet found in other places can now drop at the end of the pit run. At the end of every Pit Run is a Boss. The toughest and most time-consuming part of the run, which boss you encounter, will heavily influence how long the fight takes. Additionally, once you hit a high tier in the Pit, there are Echoes of the major bosses, such as Lilith. These Echoes have significant background effects mimicking their attacks from their own fight. For example, Echos of Lilith can cause the spikes on the ground to appear and potentially damage you. As of Season 8, Pit Bosses no longer apply the Tormented debuff when you take damage, which used to cause you to take more damage. There are at least 11 different bosses, each with their unique attacks. Some bosses have more HP than others, and some have annoying mechanics that can ruin a pit push, so when you're farming, figure out what bosses feel best for your build and which ones feel easy or difficult. The Echoes are triggered by the boss reaching certain HP breakpoints, and there are up to three different ones during each boss fight. The boss has the first one from the start, the second unlocks after the boss reaches 75% HP, while the third Echo is always the Echo of Lilith and happens at 50% remaining HP. These boss echoes are invulnerable and lurk in the background, but there are cues to their attacks, so pay attention! The Echo attacks can come in a variety of forms, depending on the echo that shows up. Elias's Echo attacks can include targeted fireballs or cones of fire. Lilith's Echo mimics attacks from her Pinnacle challenge, including the spikes in the floor and the wave patterns. Keep an eye out - dodge like your life depends on it because it does!

With all this information, here are a few more key tips to keep in mind when attempting the Pit: Maintained by: Maxroll Media Group, All Rights Reserved"
