Brand-new, this functionality allows players to change their build setups with the click of a singular button - all while being completely free! The Armory feature allows players to create multiple builds and quickly swap between them. You save your current equipment, skills, paragon points, and glyphs. This allows you to alter your character's loadout to fit the content you are about to challenge in Sanctuary. For instance, if you are about to do with some friends, you need to use a build. However, if you and your friends want to challenge at the highest level, you need an build instead. Previously, players often got stuck with one build as the process of changing took a significant amount of time. Now, the Armory allows players to press a singular button to optimize for any challenge they are approaching. At the very bottom of the interface, there are four buttons. changes the character's gear to the loadout you have selected. The button saves your character's current state into the Armory for later use. The button renames the selected loadout to a name of your choice. Finally, the button removes the selected loadout from the Armory. Finding the Armory while adventuring could not be easier as it is scattered all over Sanctuary. Access the Armory from the following locations: The location of the Armory is generally within throwing distance of a nearby Stash. If you find the Stash, you will find the Armory. This new system has a few, yet impactful, limitations that you need to be aware of. These limitations are a part of the system itself and are likely to remain in the future as well. You can avoid all of these issues (except for stash bloat!) by having items for specific builds in your stash. This is not a perfect solution, as amulets and other pieces can be incredibly rare in Diablo 4. Just make sure to check your items after equipping a loadout to ensure all aspects are correct."
