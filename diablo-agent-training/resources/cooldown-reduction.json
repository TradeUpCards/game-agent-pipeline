    "content": "Cooldown Reduction (CDR) is a powerful stat for many builds. It is used to lower your skill cooldowns which makes the gameplay loop feel smoother as you can use your buttons more often, and for some builds it even enables very powerful skill interactions once you have enough CDR. This article aims to explain the basics of Cooldown Reduction and how to acquire it, as well as go through the basic calculations of how multiple CDR sources are used by different skills. Cooldown Reduction can be found on gear, through skill passives, via the paragon board or by finding a Channeling Shrine. It is generally found in 3 forms: Cooldown Reduction from these forms combine to a total amount depending on the skill that is used, up to a cap of . For example is a Brawling skill, so it will be affected by generic CDR, skill-specific CDR for , and tag-specific CDR for Brawling skills. In this example other Brawling skills like would only be affected by the generic and Brawling skill CDR. The Channeling Shrine provides a source of 60% generic CDR for a short time that counts towards the 75% CDR cap, while at the same time also lowering the resource cost of your skills to 0. Finding one while you're playing through the world can give you an idea of how your character might be played if you had a lot of CDR passively through gear/passives/paragon once you reach the endgame, where you will have access to more powerful gear and rewards. The following table shows CDR affixes and tempers that are available to all classes, as well as all CDR tempers for each individual class (you can read more about tempering in our ). Apart from generic CDR as an affix and CDR through tempering, several unique items also have various forms of Cooldown Reduction, the most notorious of these being the mythic unique helm that not only has a big chunk of CDR, but also provides extra points to all skills which in some cases provides extra CDR for those skills (we'll look at that in the \"Cooldown Reduction from skill points\" section further down). When you have multiple sources of CDR they are combined in a special way that makes each source worth less and less the more sources you have, a sort of diminishing returns is applied to each subsequent source. The Cooldown Reduction stat in your statsheet uses the following formula: As an example, lets say we have 2 sources of CDR, one with and one with . That means we have a total of: We can think of this as if the first source of CDR brings our cooldowns to of what they were originally. When we then get the next source of CDR we bring our cooldowns to from the first source, and so on as we add more CDR sources. An important property of this method of multiplication is that fewer bigger values of CDR is better than lots of smaller values of CDR. For example lets say we have the three cases of: If we were to just add the CDR values in these cases together we'd get a total of , but when we plug them into the formula above we get: And we see that having just the 1 source of is better than the other two cases. This is one of the reasons why the mythic unique head is such an attractive item for many builds, it has a very large amount of CDR in just 1 affix which can go to 54% if it's a Greater Affix and you masterwork the CDR affix 3 times. Sometimes it's the only source of CDR that is needed for a build that relies on CDR to come online. One reason for this implementation is that CDR can be a very powerful stat and thus should be difficult to get to a high value even if you have a lot of sources. If it were easy to get all your high value skills to be on very low cooldowns, then much of the game would quickly degenerate into hitting all your buttons all the time in quick succession without much thought of interactions between skills or what the skills actually do for your gameplay. Getting the important skills of a build to have low cooldowns and then using them effectively should feel like a reward after understanding the goal of a build and successfully gearing towards that goal. Some skills with a cooldown also gain extra CDR from putting more skill points into them, up to at skill rank 20. , meaning with from gear/passives/paragon and 20 points in a skill we can get up to: on skills that are affected by skill point CDR. It should be noted that all skills with a cooldown are affected by normal CDR from gear/passives/paragon up to the cap, even if extra skill points do not lower the cooldown of said skill. Not all skills will gain extra CDR as you put more skills in them. There is not a set rule as to which skills gain CDR and which don't, but usually utility skills like Barbarian Shouts or Sorcerer Elemental Shields will not gain extra CDR with skill ranks. Below we've listed all the skills for each class that benefit from skill rank CDR. The skills mentioned above all gain a certain amount of extra CDR per extra skill rank. The amount gained is larger at the start and then becomes smaller and smaller as more points are allocated to a skill, up to a cap at rank 20 with extra CDR. The table below details how much CDR a skill gains as you add more points to them, where each rank adds more CDR to a big additive CDR pool, for example at rank 8 a skill will gain an extra CDR source of: Reviewed by"

An important property of this method of multiplication is that fewer bigger values of CDR is better than lots of smaller values of CDR.

This is one of the reasons why the mythic unique head is such an attractive item for many builds, it has a very large amount of CDR in just 1 affix which can go to 54% if it's a Greater Affix and you masterwork the CDR affix 3 times. Sometimes it's the only source of CDR that is needed for a build that relies on CDR to come online. One reason for this implementation is that CDR can be a very powerful stat and thus should be difficult to get to a high value even if you have a lot of sources. If it were easy to get all your high value skills to be on very low cooldowns, then much of the game would quickly degenerate into hitting all your buttons all the time in quick succession without much thought of interactions between skills or what the skills actually do for your gameplay. Getting the important skills of a build to have low cooldowns and then using them effectively should feel like a reward after understanding the goal of a build and successfully gearing towards that goal.

It should be noted that all skills with a cooldown are affected by normal CDR from gear/passives/paragon up to the cap, even if extra skill points do not lower the cooldown of said skill. Not all skills will gain extra CDR as you put more skills in them. There is not a set rule as to which skills gain CDR and which don't, but usually utility skills like Barbarian Shouts or Sorcerer Elemental Shields will not gain extra CDR with skill ranks. Below we've listed all the skills for each class that benefit from skill rank CDR. The skills mentioned above all gain a certain amount of extra CDR per extra skill rank.
