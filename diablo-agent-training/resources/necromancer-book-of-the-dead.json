    "content": "The Book of the Dead is a unique Minions enhancement system. You can specialize your Skeletal Warriors, Mages and Golem to fit the needs of your build. You can also choose to sacrifice your Minions, stopping your ability to summon them, but gaining powerful thematic bonuses based on the options you choose. As your Necromancer reaches higher levels, you are able to summons more types of Undead to add to your horde! While you begin your journey as a Level 1 Necromancer, with access to the Summon Skeleton Skill, you unlock many new options and combinations of summons/sacrifices as you level up that customize your gameplay experience. You actually unlock the Book of the Dead at level 5 for free, without needing to complete any quests! From here, you make decisions between two enhancements or sacrificing your Skeletons for a passive stat bonus. Below, we detail the general flavors of Minions as well as the specific stats available from in-game tooltips. There are three types of horrors the Necromancer can summon at any given time. Your Minions now gain all of your stats, so anything that buffs you now buffs your minions! must be on your skill bar to summon them. The Necromancer needs to complete a Class specific Quest to unlock the ability to summon their Golem. See our guided walkthrough below under the SPOILERS dropdown or in the listed Video: Reviewed by"
