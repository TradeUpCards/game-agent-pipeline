    "content": "The Arsenal System allows Barbarians to wield 4 weapons and assign different weapons to each of their attacks. Each weapon gives a different Expertise bonus to the Barbarian's attacks. In addition, the Technique Slot is unlocked via a quest chain at level 15. Let's learn everything we currently know about the Arsenal System to smash our enemies to pieces! The Arsenal System is automatically available when you reach Level 5. Opening the Expertise tab (Shift + C) shows all the different weapon types and the bonuses they give to attacks using them. Each Weapon Expertise starts at Rank 0 out of 10, and scales linearly as it levels up. An Additional Bonus is unlocked at Rank 10. Here is the complete list of all powers and bonuses: In addition to getting the Weapon Expertise bonus for the weapon they are currently using, Barbarians also get the benefit of the Weapon Expertise they have assigned to their Technique Slot regardless of what weapon they are using. Note that the Technique slot only gives the first part of Expertise, not the Rank 10 Additional Bonus. The Weapon Expertise and the Weapon Technique stack, so it's okay (and sometimes optimal) to assign a weapon currently in use to the Technique slot. Two of the most common choices are: to all enemies. This has tremendous synergy with to deal more At Level 15 you receive a key quest to unlock the Technique Slot in the Dry Steppes. This is extremely easy to complete: 1. Go to the town and accept the quest. 2. Head Northwest and slay the required monsters marked by red dots. 3. Head East and slay the beast in the cave. 4. Return to town and you're done! The first order of business is to assign the weapon for your main damage ability. Do this by opening the Skill Assignment menu through the Skill Tree, hovering over the skill on the skill bar that you want to assign a weapon to, and selecting Cycle Weapons. This will cycle the skill's Arsenal Selection between Auto-Select, Dual Wield, Bludgeoning, and Slashing. For your primary damage-dealing ability, it most important to pick a weapon based on it's DPS. The Auto-Select option will do this automatically for all skills by default. In some cases, the weapon type and its Weapon Expertise bonus can have a big impact on the skill's damage and its utility. Some of your weapons may not have a high DPS and/or may not have very valuable Weapon Expertise bonuses, and you may not assign them to any skills. You can think of these weapons as \"stat-sticks.\" They contribute valuable affixes to your character's stats, but since they are never actually wielded when performing attacks, their DPS and their Weapon Expertise bonuses do not matter. Leveling up the Arsenal System is a natural process. As you pick up new weapons and battle monsters, the corresponding weapons you're using gain experience. Getting up to Level 10 with all weapons is not very difficult, and can easily be done by casual players. A few things to note: Contributions by Reviewed by"
