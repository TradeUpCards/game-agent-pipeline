    "content": "First appearing in Diablo II, Runewords have long been a fan favorite, and they're back in the new Expansion for Diablo IV, Vessel of Hatred. Runewords offer exciting new customization opportunities for your characters and introduce a new mechanic to power up your character and access abilities from other classes. Let's learn about how to take our characters to another level in this new expansion! There are two types of Runes available in Vessel of Hatred, and these two types of Runes combine to form a Runeword. A Runeword is comprised of one Rune of Ritual and one Rune of Invocation, and you can only have two Runewords on a character. You cannot use two of the same Runes, nor can you use two Runes of Ritual or two Runes of Invocation in the same item (e.g., you cannot combine , nor can you use as your Rune of Ritual in both Runewords on your character). The Runes have to be socketed into the same item. That is, Runewords can only be created in items with two sockets, this includes Helm, Chest, Legs, and 2H Weapon. You also cannot equip both Gems and Runes in the same item, so you have to select one or the other. Both types of Runes can drop in rarity and the higher the rarity, the stronger the effect is. Runes are Tradeable and stored in the new Socketables tab. Runes of Ritual serve as the 'cause' of the Runewords, and provide a condition you must meet to generate Offering. Once you reach a certain amount of Offering, you trigger the Runes of Invocation. The more demanding the Rune of Ritual (e.g., the more difficult of a condition it is to meet), the more Offering you get in one go. There are currently 17 Runes of Ritual. Runes of Invocation are the 'effect' part of the 'cause and effect' of Runewords. Once you meet the required Offering, you trigger the effect of the Rune of Invocation. This can be anything from granting you access to a skill, to increasing skill ranks, to restoring resource or life. Additionally, Runes of Invocation can have Overflow effects. If you provide more Offering than is needed, you can trigger additional criteria for some Runes. This is all detailed in their tooltip. There are currently 27 Runes of Invocation: Runewords come with a few important mechanics you should be aware of. Creating a Runeword is as simple as combining a Rune of Ritual and a Rune of Invocation. Let's take , the Runes shown above. By placing in the same item, you've created , a Runeword. Now, every time you travel 25 meters, you've accumulated 400 Offering. Once you have accumulated 400 Offering, you trigger , and your next Evade is replaced with Let's say you had a Rune of Ritual that generated 100 Offering, and you were using a Rune of Invocation that activated at 50 Offering. This would lead to a surplus of Offering, some extra. This is called Overflow. The bonus applied is proportional to how much Overflow is acquired, so stack as much as you can! Runes can drop from various activities within Diablo 4, and can only drop if the player has the Vessel of Hatred expansion. The following is a list of activities that frequently drops Runes. While Runes can be obtained from drops in Sanctuary, you can also craft them at the . You use 3 Runes with the same name (e.g., three Runes) to craft a random Rune. If using non-Legendary Runes, you have a chance to create a Rune of the next highest rarity. The Rune created while crafting is guaranteed to be different than the one used. For example, you can craft Maintained by"
