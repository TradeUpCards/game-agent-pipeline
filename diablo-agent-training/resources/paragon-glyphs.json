Learn everything you need to know about them below! Glyphs are easy to get but may take a while to obtain before having the full set you require for your build. Once you hit level 60, any activity has a chance of dropping a Glyph for you. The best way, as you could guess, is to run . You can open your Paragon Board and check for the ones you have obtained and which have not yet been found. They can look very similar to regular items when dropped, so be on the lookout to not miss any. For example, grants +3.0% increased Lightning damage for every 5 Dexterity allocated in range. The additional bonus requires you to reach 25 Dexterity on allocated Paragon Nodes in its Radius. You should put this into a Glyph Socket that has as much Dexterity in range as possible. Once the Glyph reaches level 46, it becomes and gains an additional radius increase to its maximum of 5. This increase is extremely powerful as it gives you access to a new multiplier at the bottom of the Glyph. To use a Glyph, you have to place it into a Socket Node on your Paragon Board. Each board has one of these Nodes. Every Glyph has a \"base bonus\" that applies to your character when socketed. Glyphs have an additional bonus that is unlocked when the specified Attribute from allocated Paragon Nodes is reached. Make sure to unlock these secondary bonuses! Each class has its own list of Glyphs: Players who manage to clear the entire pit and slay the boss before the timer runs out can upgrade their glyphs. If you successfully clear the pit, you gain: Depending on the difficulty of the pit, the odds of successfully upgrading your glyph increase based on the level difference between the glyph and the pit run. This chance is 100% if the Pit level is 10 levels ahead of the Glyph, with reduced effectiveness if the Pit level is closer to the Glyph's level. If the level difference between your glyph and the Pit level is greater than 20, your glyph gets an additional upgrade. The max level of glyphs has been increased from level 21 to level 100. Once you reach Glyph level 45, it costs 10k gem fragments to upgrade from quality, giving it an additional radius size and a new affix. Maintained by"
