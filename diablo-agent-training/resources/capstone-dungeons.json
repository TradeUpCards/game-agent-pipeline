A wise strategy is to outlevel this dungeon because the enemies do not scale beyond level 70. The Animus Carriers and the boss here can be extremely challenging. Make sure you prepare survivability and pack a boss specific build and don't forget an elixir too for extra tankiness. Elias is a tough boss that can deal incredible damage if you are not prepared for his attacks. Reviewed by Maxroll Media Group, All Rights Reserved"
