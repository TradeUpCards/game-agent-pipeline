By using Tempering Manuals that are found randomly throughout the world of Diablo 4, players can learn Tempering Recipes that can be used unlimited times. After selecting a piece of equipment, selecting the Tempering Recipe, and supplying the materials to a , a random Tempering Affix from the selected Tempering Recipe is rolled on the equipment. Players can reroll these Affixes up to 5 times if they are unhappy with the results. However, if you are lucky enough to find an item with a Greater Affix (GA), you can re-roll an item an additional time for each Greater Affix on the item. The Tempering system makes use of new items called Tempering Manuals. Use a manual to learn the Tempering Recipe permanently. There is no limit to how many times players can reuse a recipe once they've learned it. Each Manual teaches a Recipe that contains between 3 to 5 different Tempering Affixes. Tempering Manuals can drop from most content in-game. They have a high chance of finding them from completing events and defeating monsters in , defeating world bosses, completing dungeons, , and other endgame activities. Here's where they can be found: Tempering Manuals are class-bound (e.g., only Rogues will find Rogue Temper Manuals) when being discovered, and Tempering your equipment with another class' Tempering Manual will cause the tempering to be inactive on other classes. You cannot temper your equipment with, say, Cold Damage from a Sorcerer and use it on a Rogue. The Tempering Manuals and Tempering Recipes are categorized similarly to Aspects in the Codex of Power (eg: Resource, Mobility, etc). Each of the six categories corresponds to a subset of item types: items can have two Tempering Affixes, while items can only have one. However, each Tempering Affix added to equipment must belong to a different category. For example, a Helm can have two Tempering Affixes, but one must be a Defensive Tempering Affix and the other must be a Utility Tempering Affix. Rearranging the above list, we can see the full list of compatible Recipe categories for each equipment type: The cost is based on the Item Power of the selected equipment. The more powerful the item, the more materials it requires. This cost is the same for all equipment types given that they are the same Item Power, but certain materials like change depending on the item type. For example, tempering an Ancestral piece of equipment has the following cost: When tempering an item, a single Tempering Affix is picked randomly from the selected Recipe. This means that you are less likely to get the Tempering Affix you desire if the Recipe has a lot of options on it. Players can reroll Tempering Affixes multiple times, up to the item’s Tempering charge limit. Items have 5 charges (or 8 if the item has three Greater Affixes on it), and once you reach 0, you can no longer temper the item. Tempering doesn't allow you to keep the previous result, so you should never try to get a better roll on a good affix unless you are comfortable with bricking the item. If you do brick an item, you can use a . This ONLY restores your Tempering Charges, allowing you more attempts to get the Affix you desire within the same Tempering Category previously applied on the item. You can obtain this powerful scroll from the and the equipment chest at the end of the . This scroll can only be used if all Tempering Charges have been spent, and you can check if a scroll has been previously applied to an item by using the Scroll before all charges have been depleted: These error messages can only be seen if you have the \"Error Notifications\" option turned on under Options > Gameplay > Error Notifications. Players would be wise to anticipate that they will not get exactly the affixes they want, especially if the recipes contain a large number of affixes. An otherwise perfect item can be \"bricked\" by the process of rerolling Tempering Affixes if the player has bad luck. For example, if a player wants one affix from a recipe of 4 and another from a recipe of 5, there is only a 49% chance of getting both within 5 rerolls."

Players can reroll Tempering Affixes multiple times, up to the item’s Tempering charge limit. Items have 5 charges (or 8 if the item has three Greater Affixes on it), and once you reach 0, you can no longer temper the item. Tempering doesn't allow you to keep the previous result, so you should never try to get a better roll on a good affix unless you are comfortable with bricking the item.
