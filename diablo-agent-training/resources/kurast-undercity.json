    "content": "The Vessel of Hatred Expansion for Diablo IV comes with a new intense multi-stage, speed-based dungeon perfect for character progression called the Kurast Undercity. Unlocked around level 20, it helps you prepare for the endgame activities you face while also being an excellent method of target farming items in the endgame. A brand new time trial-style activity, the is a targeted way to help you both level and gain advanced gear. You start with a timer when you enter, but as you fight afflicted monsters, you gain more time. As you fight these monsters and complete various events within the Undercity, you earn . You also encounter Tributes, which drop both in the Undercity and Sanctuary itself. Tributes are used to augment future runs and target-farm specific rewards. If you finish fast enough, you face one of the all-new bosses in the Undercity and have to fight your way through them to receive your spoils! Higher quality tributes yield the highest spoils, and like all endgame activities in the new Vessel of Hatred, the rewards scale with your world Difficulty tier. To access this new content, you must progress the Vessel of Hatred campaign until you get a priority quest sending you to explore the depths of Kurast Undercity. This quest introduces you to all the bosses at the end of the Undercity, and prepares you for the challenges to come. Finishing this quest permanently unlocks the Spirit Brazier, which allows you to travel into the Undercity at any point. Tributes in the Kurast Undercity grant you extra rewards at the end of the run. The available Tributes in-game and their specific rewards are: With great rewards come great risks, as players have to use to have a chance at clearing the Undercity in time and with at least Attunement Rank 1 completed. Players have to deal with the following in these more difficult runs: This may sound like a piece of cake, but make no mistake, the reduced time in the Undercity is brutal and only the fastest builds can clear the most difficult versions of these Tributes. These Tributes can be found all over Sanctuary, with being able to drop from summoned bosses as well. You may have noticed the (Resolute) and (United) tags for the legendary and the unique Tributes. In short, a Tribute being Resolute means that only the player who activates the Tribute will benefit from the extra bonuses, while a United Tribute will benefit all players at the end of the run, meaning these are earmarked for group play. The Bargain system in the Kurast Undercity allows players even more control over rewards at the end of the run. This is a completely optional system that allows players to offer materials to the Spirit Braizer, and in return get specific rewards at the end of a completed run. There are several mechanics in the Undercity that influence your decisions throughout the run. These mechanics are quite simple in nature, but have a massive impact on how you clear the Undercity efficiently for maximum rewards. When you enter the Undercity, you are spawned into a large circle. This circle stops the timer from depleteing and appears at the start of every floor. Once you leave the circle, the timer begins to deplete over time, and depending on the level of Tribute you have placed in the Spirit Braizer, you start with a certain amount. You can extend your timer by slaying Afflicted enemies spread out across all three floors of the Undercity. Slaying afflicted enemies allows you to extend the timer beyond the starting time and keeps the run from finishing before reaching the final boss room. There are a few types of afflicted enemies within the Kurast Undercity, all of which add different amounts of time when slain. This bonus is reduced depending on the level of Tribute you have active during your run! These enemies can spawn in every nook and cranny, so make sure to keep your eyes on the minimap for the skulls indicating where they are. The size of the skull on the minimap denotes which type of afflicted enemy it is, so plan your cooldowns accordingly! Attunement is the main mechanic of the Undercity which dictates how many rewards you receive at the end of the run. This is represented as a four-staged bar underneath your minimap. To receive the minimum rewards from your tribute, you must reach Attunement level 1. There are three main ways of obtaining Attunement in the Undercity: Slaying enemies grants you small amounts of attunement for each kill, but the main bursts come from igniting Beacons and slaying Goblins. Treasure Goblins rarely spawn within the Undercity. If you find one, slay it quickly as these Goblins jump through portals to avoid you for as long as possible to waste time. When you ignite Beacons, you spawn enemies around it. All of these new enemies need to be slain for Attunement to be awarded to the player, so try to ignite it quickly before unleashing your attacks on all surrounding enemies. When you reach the final floor of the Undercity, your timer disappears and you reach the boss of the Undercity. There are currently three different bosses in the game: , the Golden, , the Wretched, and , Kurast's End. These bosses have unique mechanics which forces the players to react accordingly to prevent death."

When you enter the Undercity, you are spawned into a large circle. This circle stops the timer from depleteing and appears at the start of every floor. Once you leave the circle, the timer begins to deplete over time, and depending on the level of Tribute you have placed in the Spirit Braizer, you start with a certain amount. You can extend your timer by slaying Afflicted enemies spread out across all three floors of the Undercity. Slaying afflicted enemies allows you to extend the timer beyond the starting time and keeps the run from finishing before reaching the final boss room. There are a few types of afflicted enemies within the Kurast Undercity, all of which add different amounts of time when slain. This bonus is reduced depending on the level of Tribute you have active during your run! These enemies can spawn in every nook and cranny, so make sure to keep your eyes on the minimap for the skulls indicating where they are. The size of the skull on the minimap denotes which type of afflicted enemy it is, so plan your cooldowns accordingly! Attunement is the main mechanic of the Undercity which dictates how many rewards you receive at the end of the run. This is represented as a four-staged bar underneath your minimap. To receive the minimum rewards from your tribute, you must reach Attunement level 1. There are three main ways of obtaining Attunement in the Undercity: Slaying enemies grants you small amounts of attunement for each kill, but the main bursts come from igniting Beacons and slaying Goblins. Treasure Goblins rarely spawn within the Undercity. If you find one, slay it quickly as these Goblins jump through portals to avoid you for as long as possible to waste time. When you ignite Beacons, you spawn enemies around it. All of these new enemies need to be slain for Attunement to be awarded to the player, so try to ignite it quickly before unleashing your attacks on all surrounding enemies. When you reach the final floor of the Undercity, your timer disappears and you reach the boss of the Undercity. There are currently three different bosses in the game: , the Golden, , the Wretched, and , Kurast's End. These bosses have unique mechanics which forces the players to react accordingly to prevent death."
