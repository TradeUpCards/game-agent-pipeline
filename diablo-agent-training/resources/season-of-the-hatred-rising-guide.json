    "content": "Diablo 4 strikes again with season 6 : released alongside the new expansion Vessel of Hatred! Seasons within Diablo IV bear their mark on Sanctuary in the Seasonal Realm similarly to late , unearthing new quests and fresh mechanics to explore and master. Gargantuan heralds of Hell bearing sanguine-eyed portals on their backs have been spotted stomping about Sanctuary. Their presence is a grim tavern tale—a harmless prank meant to scare the weary traveler—turned into reality by Mephisto’s hatred. They are known locally as Realmwalkers. Realmwalkers can threaten an entire Region at once, spewing out nightmares born of hatred from the portal fused into their bodies. By Mephisto’s will, a Realmwalker will spawn in a Region, and after charging up, it will begin to lumber about the Region in search of sacred ground. Realmwalkers are invulnerable during this phase, but fearsome Bloodbound Guardians will rush to protect the Realmwalker while it wanders. Eliminate them to remove chunks of the Realmwalker’s health. When the Realmwalker arrives at the ritual site, it’ll slam into the ground, creating three Hatred Spires around it. Dismantle these spires quickly and render the Realmwalker vulnerable before it acquires too much power. Once the Hatred Spires have fallen, you can finish the job. Put the demonic behemoth to rest! After the beast has fallen and glory claimed in your name, the truest test of your mettle begins: you may now enter the portal it leaves behind. Throughout Estuar, the continent home to the 5 Regions of Diablo IV’s base game, a Realmwalker will spawn in a Region every 15 minutes, rotating locations each time. Once an hour, a second Realmwalker will appear in Nahantu in addition to being somewhere in Estuar. The Tree of Whispers demands the power of the Realmwalkers! The first Realmwalker of every hour spawned in Estuar will be a Whisper. Every 3 hours, the Realmwalker spawned in Nahantu will be a Whisper. One bitter challenge breeds a new one: a Seething Realm. The Realmwalker’s defeat has left a crimson portal at your feet. You must venture forth to put an end to this ploy of Mephisto’s. The air inside the dungeon might feel still, but a fast-approaching chorus of footsteps suggests otherwise. Seething Realms are dungeons rife with ranks of monsters to slay and treasure to claim. You’ll need to carve a path through the dungeon to locate the Realm Gate. Once there, you’ll be presented with a choice to offer up certain materials. Select the Seething Opal you wish to receive as your reward upon completing the rest of the Seething Realm dungeon. Seething Opals are a new type of Elixir that provides you with a 15% experience increase and other bonuses for 30 minutes at a time. There are 5 Seething Opals in total. Note that the Seething Opal of Torment can only be acquired while you’re playing on Torment Difficulty I or higher. The material cost to select them as your reward at the Realm Gate and full effects can be seen below. and are playing on Penitent Difficulty or higher in a Nahantu-based Seething Realm dungeon. After a failed attempt to locate Akarat’s tomb, the surviving Zakarum Remnants licked their wounds in Hawezar. Directionless, they searched for meaning and a use for the stockpile of equipment lying in their armory. The appearance of Realwalkers through Mephisto’s hatred has provided the Remnants with renewed purpose and a target to strike against. Lend the order a hand in protecting Sanctuary! Visit Crusader Damond in Zarbinzet, Hawezar to begin the quest, where you’ll learn how to annihilate Realmwalkers and harness the arcane power of the Seething Realms to acquire useful Seething Opals. You must either complete the final quest in the base game’s campaign— —or opt to skip the base game’s main questline to embark on Damond’s quest. It may not be Akarat’s tomb, but the Remnants have unearthed components to aid in the conflict against the Burning Hells. They’ll happily grant you these curios as a reward for extinguishing Realmwalkers, completing Seething Realms, and carving through monsters anywhere while you have an active Seething Opal effect."

    "content": "Seething Realms are dungeons rife with ranks of monsters to slay and treasure to claim. You’ll need to carve a path through the dungeon to locate the Realm Gate. Once there, you’ll be presented with a choice to offer up certain materials. Select the Seething Opal you wish to receive as your reward upon completing the rest of the Seething Realm dungeon. Seething Opals are a new type of Elixir that provides you with a 15% experience increase and other bonuses for 30 minutes at a time. There are 5 Seething Opals in total. Note that the Seething Opal of Torment can only be acquired while you’re playing on Torment Difficulty I or higher. The material cost to select them as your reward at the Realm Gate and full effects can be seen below. and are playing on Penitent Difficulty or higher in a Nahantu-based Seething Realm dungeon. After a failed attempt to locate Akarat’s tomb, the surviving Zakarum Remnants licked their wounds in Hawezar. Directionless, they searched for meaning and a use for the stockpile of equipment lying in their armory. The appearance of Realwalkers through Mephisto’s hatred has provided the Remnants with renewed purpose and a target to strike against. Lend the order a hand in protecting Sanctuary! Visit Crusader Damond in Zarbinzet, Hawezar to begin the quest, where you’ll learn how to annihilate Realmwalkers and harness the arcane power of the Seething Realms to acquire useful Seething Opals. You must either complete the final quest in the base game’s campaign— —or opt to skip the base game’s main questline to embark on Damond’s quest. It may not be Akarat’s tomb, but the Remnants have unearthed components to aid in the conflict against the Burning Hells. They’ll happily grant you these curios as a reward for extinguishing Realmwalkers, completing Seething Realms, and carving through monsters anywhere while you have an active Seething Opal effect."
