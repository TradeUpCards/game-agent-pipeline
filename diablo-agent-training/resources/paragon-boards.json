    "content": "Paragon Boards when unlocked are a powerful way to continue progressing your character after reaching level 60. You place points in Normal Nodes to increase your character’s base Attributes, which are important for Glyphs later on. You can also select from more specialized that enhance certain affixes or skills you are using. Glyphs are particularly strong enhancements and can only be placed into a Glyph Socket on a Paragon Board. Ultimately, the system forces you to make meaningful decisions that can impact your build greatly. Make as efficient use of your points as possible! The boards are structured with 6 different node types that are combined to create a massive grid for you to navigate through. These Nodes are the \"veins\" of Paragon Boards. They connect all other nodes and always grant +5 to an Attribute (Strength, Intelligence, Willpower, or Dexterity). Choosing the correct route allows you to unlock additional bonuses from and Glyphs, as they require a minimum amount of certain Attributes to achieve. These Nodes can give larger amounts of Attributes compared to Normal Nodes or grant a power affix bonuses. There are always 5 Nodes surrounding any Node at all times. While leveling, they are a nice increase to your character's power. Be sure the bonus they provide works with your build prior to selecting them to not waste points. Nodes that are near are especially valuable to either increase a Glyph's power or when the placed Glyph increases Nodes' power in its Radius. These Nodes have a significant impact on your character's build. They are especially powerful while leveling up. consist of 2 Attributes and a Bonus that needs to be unlocked. To do so, your character must meet the minimum Attribute requirement stated on the Node. This requirement consists of one or two Attributes. When you attach multiple Paragon Boards, the thresholds for those Bonuses increase, making them more difficult to unlock. requires both Intelligence and Willpower. The base Node grants 14% Core Skill Damage and 35% Basic Skill Damage. When both requirements are met, the Core Skill Value doubles to 28% and the line turns green to indicate that the Bonus is unlocked. These are the flashy orange nodes that the entire Board is designed around and named after. Because of this, many players assume they are also the most important nodes on the Board, and this is often the case. However, the other options we cover below can be just as important or more, so don't just assume that the is all that matters! Consider all of the important nodes on a Board before committing. If two Nodes are similar in power, a good node or well-placed Glyph socket may be the difference. One important factor to bear in mind is that offensive nodes provide multiplicative damage, which makes them even more powerful than they may seem. If it fits really well with your build, then it should be factored heavily in your decision to use the board. Glyph sockets are the most complex of all the nodes and will require the most thought and planning to get the most out of. Glyphs are acquired as drops and can be placed in these special sockets. Each Glyph has an effect that either improves the power of nearby nodes or draws power from nearby nodes to grant a special effect. Make sure to read the description carefully to understand how to maximize these benefits Once you understand the benefits, the biggest factor for your board is determining what sockets will be most beneficial to the Glyphs you want to use.  For example, a Glyph that provides a bonus to nodes within range should be used in a socket that has the most impactful nodes nearby so that you get the most benefit. A Glyph that gets stronger from selecting nodes with a certain attribute will want to be in a socket that has the most density for that attribute within range. To attach a new Paragon Board, you have to reach something called a Board Attachment Gate. These Nodes connect one Paragon Board to another one. Every board contains four Board Attachment Gates in the center of the four board edges. One is used to enter the board, the other three can be used to connect the next board. They also grant +5 to all Attributes. Since you won't be able to invest in every board, you need to choose the best and leave the rest. How you choose those is going to vary somewhat from build to build, but here's some general rules to follow: Paragon Points are a limited resource. There are only three ways to gain them: When you complete all of these objectives, you gain up to 327 Paragon Points. These Paragon Points are used to path across the Paragon Boards and reach the various Paragon Nodes across them. When you reach a Board Attachment Gate, you have the option to select your next Paragon Board. Every class has 8 unique Paragon Boards to choose from. As of Season 6, you can have a maximum of 5 boards including the starting board. Initially, you get an overview of each board's Nodes. Each board has a specific theme, for example, the board focuses on the Imbuement Skills of the Rogue. When you hit the \"Preview\" button, the Board Preview Mode shows up. Here you can see the layout of the selected board and rotate it in 90° steps, allowing you to optimize your path through it. When you are happy with the board and its rotation, you hit the \"Attach Board\" button to finalize your decision. You can also cancel the preview and go back to the Board Selection. When you've selected the Boards you want to use, it's time to plan out your path through the connected Boards. This step is all about maximizing efficiency; we want to get the most possible desirable nodes into our board within the allotted points while also prioritizing the very best ones. To accomplish this, we need to employ several strategies. We do this for every board, starting from highest priority to lowest, until we've exhausted all of our points and cannot find a more optimal path that maximizes the amount of desired nodes we can pick up. The first thing we want to accomplish is finding the shortest route through each of our boards that still picks up all of the major nodes we want.  This is usually accomplished by taking the most direct path to each node, starting with the node closest to the entrance to the board first and ending with the node closest to the exit. Nodes in between these two can be trickier, but you can generally move to the next closest until you reach the exit. Due to the way some boards are set up, it may make more sense to branch out to access a valuable node or cluster and then go back to a previous one to continue on the path. Speaking of the exit, when possible always choose the one that is closest to a node that you can end with. This will save you several points that you can use elsewhere. Boards have 4 different connection points, and the orientation of each Board is not static. They can be rotated 90 degrees, which allows you to connect a Board from any point. Use this to your advantage to create the shortest possible path and avoid wasting points. Having the ability to rotate your boards also means you don't have to worry about which connection point you end at, since the next Board can be reoriented to accommodate the connection point. The only exception to this is if the ending point on the Board would lead you back into a previously established board, preventing a connection to a new board. Sometimes a Board will have multiple valuable nodes on it that are very far away from each other, and the stuff in between provides little additional value. In these cases, it may be better to jump into a Board multiple times. In this scenario, we would enter a Board near a valuable node and then immediately move on to the nearest exit node. We would then set up the rest of our boards in a way that could circle back to the other side of the Board with the far away nodes. This only works if we have enough additional boards to invest in and naturally want the points in them. It can take a lot of planning to pull off, but success can mean saving several points to spend in more valuable areas. Early on you simply focus on rushing to specific nodes that empowers your character. Later on, this can be optimized as we have an abundance of Paragon Points to use in the endgame. A strategic Paragon Board reset is utilized by builds that benefits from a specific route early on, but once you have progressed further in the build can change for something more optimal. This is communicated in our build guides with the Paragon Board progression slider, where one step features a completely new layout compared to the previous one. Glyphs are a powerful addition to further enhance your character after reaching Level 60. They are rune-like items that are placed in special Socket Nodes on each board. These glyphs can be leveled in , but to understand how to utilize these powerful additions to your endgame power, lets elaborate what a Glyph is and where you can find them. A Paragon Glyph is your way of empowering your endgame build further through powerful effects such as increased damage dealt versus enemies, or gaining more energy after using an agility skill. These customizations puts your build apart from others and allows your character to grow stronger the further you progress in . To fully understand how a Glyph is structured and functions, let us look into For example, grants +3.0% increased Lightning damage for every 5 Dexterity allocated in range. The additional bonus requires you to reach 25 Dexterity on allocated Paragon Nodes in its Radius. You should put this into a Glyph Socket that has as much Dexterity in range as possible. Once the Glyph reaches level 46, it becomes and gains an additional radius increase to its maximum of 5. This increase is extremely powerful as it gives you access to a new Legendary Bonus multiplier at the bottom of the Glyph. To use a Glyph, you have to place it into a Socket Node on your Paragon Board. Each board has one of these Nodes. Every Glyph has a \"base bonus\" that applies to your character when socketed. Glyphs have an additional bonus that is unlocked when the specified Attribute from allocated Paragon Nodes is reached. Make sure to unlock these secondary bonuses! Obtaining these powerful Glyphs is easy, but may take a while to obtain before having the full set you require for your build. Once you hit level 60, any activity has a chance of dropping a Glyph for you. The best way, as you could guess, is to run . You can open your Paragon Board and check for the ones you have obtained and which have not yet been found. They can look very similar to regular items when dropped, so be on the lookout to not miss any. Players who manage to clear the entire pit and slay the boss before the timer runs out can upgrade their glyphs. If you successfully clear the pit, you gain: Depending on the difficulty of the pit, the odds of successfully upgrading your glyph increase based on the level difference between the glyph and the pit run. This chance is 100% if the Pit level is 10 levels ahead of the Glyph, with reduced effectiveness if the Pit level is closer to the Glyph's level. If the level difference between your glyph and the Pit level is greater than 20, your glyph gets an additional upgrade. The max level of glyphs has been increased from level 21 to level 100. Once you reach Glyph level 45, it costs 10k gem fragments to upgrade from quality, giving it an additional radius size and a new affix. Maintained by"

If you successfully clear the pit, you gain: Depending on the difficulty of the pit, the odds of successfully upgrading your glyph increase based on the level difference between the glyph and the pit run. This chance is 100% if the Pit level is 10 levels ahead of the Glyph, with reduced effectiveness if the Pit level is closer to the Glyph's level. If the level difference between your glyph and the Pit level is greater than 20, your glyph gets an additional upgrade. The max level of glyphs has been increased from level 21 to level 100.

These Nodes can give larger amounts of Attributes compared to Normal Nodes or grant a power affix bonuses. There are always 5 Nodes surrounding any Node at all times.

These Nodes have a significant impact on your character's build. They are especially powerful while leveling up. consist of 2 Attributes and a Bonus that needs to be unlocked. To do so, your character must meet the minimum Attribute requirement stated on the Node. This requirement consists of one or two Attributes. When you attach multiple Paragon Boards, the thresholds for those Bonuses increase, making them more difficult to unlock. requires both Intelligence and Willpower. The base Node grants 14% Core Skill Damage and 35% Basic Skill Damage. When both requirements are met, the Core Skill Value doubles to 28% and the line turns green to indicate that the Bonus is unlocked. These are the flashy orange nodes that the entire Board is designed around and named after. Because of this, many players assume they are also the most important nodes on the Board, and this is often the case. However, the other options we cover below can be just as important or more, so don't just assume that the is all that matters! Consider all of the important nodes on a Board before committing. If two Nodes are similar in power, a good node or well-placed Glyph socket may be the difference. One important factor to bear in mind is that offensive nodes provide multiplicative damage, which makes them even more powerful than they may seem. If it fits really well with your build, then it should be factored heavily in your decision to use the board. Glyph sockets are the most complex of all the nodes and will require the most thought and planning to get the most out of. Glyphs are acquired as drops and can be placed in these special sockets. Each Glyph has an effect that either improves the power of nearby nodes or draws power from nearby nodes to grant a special effect. Make sure to read the description carefully to understand how to maximize these benefits Once you understand the benefits, the biggest factor for your board is determining what sockets will be most beneficial to the Glyphs you want to use.  For example, a Glyph that provides a bonus to nodes within range should be used in a socket that has the most impactful nodes nearby so that you get the most benefit. A Glyph that gets stronger from selecting nodes with a certain attribute will want to be in a socket that has the most density for that attribute within range. To attach a new Paragon Board, you have to reach something called a Board Attachment Gate. These Nodes connect one Paragon Board to another one. Every board contains four Board Attachment Gates in the center of the four board edges. One is used to enter the board, the other three can be used to connect the next board. They also grant +5 to all Attributes. Since you won't be able to invest in every board, you need to choose the best and leave the rest. How you choose those is going to vary somewhat from build to build, but here's some general rules to follow: Paragon Points are a limited resource. There are only three ways to gain them: When you complete all of these objectives, you gain up to 327 Paragon Points. These Paragon Points are used to path across the Paragon Boards and reach the various Paragon Nodes across them. When you reach a Board Attachment Gate, you have the option to select your next Paragon Board. Every class has 8 unique Paragon Boards to choose from. As of Season 6, you can have a maximum of 5 boards including the starting board. Initially, you get an overview of each board's Nodes. Each board has a specific theme, for example, the board focuses on the Imbuement Skills of the Rogue. When you hit the \"Preview\" button, the Board Preview Mode shows up. Here you can see the layout of the selected board and rotate it in 90° steps, allowing you to optimize your path through it. When you are happy with the board and its rotation, you hit the \"Attach Board\" button to finalize your decision. You can also cancel the preview and go back to the Board Selection. When you've selected the Boards you want to use, it's time to plan out your path through the connected Boards. This step is all about maximizing efficiency; we want to get the most possible desirable nodes into our board within the allotted points while also prioritizing the very best ones. To accomplish this, we need to employ several strategies. We do this for every board, starting from highest priority to lowest, until we've exhausted all of our points and cannot find a more optimal path that maximizes the amount of desired nodes we can pick up. The first thing we want to accomplish is finding the shortest route through each of our boards that still picks up all of the major nodes we want.  This is usually accomplished by taking the most direct path to each node, starting with the node closest to the entrance to the board first and ending with the node closest to the exit. Nodes in between these two can be trickier, but you can generally move to the next closest until you reach the exit. Due to the way some boards are set up, it may make more sense to branch out to access a valuable node or cluster and then go back to a previous one to continue on the path. Speaking of the exit, when possible always choose the one that is closest to a node that you can end with. This will save you several points that you can use elsewhere. Boards have 4 different connection points, and the orientation of each Board is not static. They can be rotated 90 degrees, which allows you to connect a Board from any point. Use this to your advantage to create the shortest possible path and avoid wasting points. Having the ability to rotate your boards also means you don't have to worry about which connection point you end at, since the next Board can be reoriented to accommodate the connection point. The only exception to this is if the ending point on the Board would lead you back into a previously established board, preventing a connection to a new board. Sometimes a Board will have multiple valuable nodes on it that are very far away from each other, and the stuff in between provides little additional value. In these cases, it may be better to jump into a Board multiple times. In this scenario, we would enter a Board near a valuable node and then immediately move on to the nearest exit node. We would then set up the rest of our boards in a way that could circle back to the other side of the Board with the far away nodes. This only works if we have enough additional boards to invest in and naturally want the points in them. It can take a lot of planning to pull off, but success can mean saving several points to spend in more valuable areas. Early on you simply focus on rushing to specific nodes that empowers your character. Later on, this can be optimized as we have an abundance of Paragon Points to use in the endgame. A strategic Paragon Board reset is utilized by builds that benefits from a specific route early on, but once you have progressed further in the build can change for something more optimal. This is communicated in our build guides with the Paragon Board progression slider, where one step features a completely new layout compared to the previous one. Glyphs are a powerful addition to further enhance your character after reaching Level 60. They are rune-like items that are placed in special Socket Nodes on each board. These glyphs can be leveled in , but to understand how to utilize these powerful additions to your endgame power, lets elaborate what a Glyph is and where you can find them. A Paragon Glyph is your way of empowering your endgame build further through powerful effects such as increased damage dealt versus enemies, or gaining more energy after using an agility skill. These customizations puts your build apart from others and allows your character to grow stronger the further you progress in . To fully understand how a Glyph is structured and functions, let us look into For example, grants +3.0% increased Lightning damage for every 5 Dexterity allocated in range. The additional bonus requires you to reach 25 Dexterity on allocated Paragon Nodes in its Radius. You should put this into a Glyph Socket that has as much Dexterity in range as possible. Once the Glyph reaches level 46, it becomes and gains an additional radius increase to its maximum of 5. This increase is extremely powerful as it gives you access to a new Legendary Bonus multiplier at the bottom of the Glyph. To use a Glyph, you have to place it into a Socket Node on your Paragon Board. Each board has one of these Nodes. Every Glyph has a \"base bonus\" that applies to your character when socketed. Glyphs have an additional bonus that is unlocked when the specified Attribute from allocated Paragon Nodes is reached. Make sure to unlock these secondary bonuses! Obtaining these powerful Glyphs is easy, but may take a while to obtain before having the full set you require for your build. Once you hit level 60, any activity has a chance of dropping a Glyph for you. The best way, as you could guess, is to run . You can open your Paragon Board and check for the ones you have obtained and which have not yet been found. They can look very similar to regular items when dropped, so be on the lookout to not miss any. Players who manage to clear the entire pit and slay the boss before the timer runs out can upgrade their glyphs.

Here you can see the layout of the selected board and rotate it in 90° steps, allowing you to optimize your path through it. When you are happy with the board and its rotation, you hit the \"Attach Board\" button to finalize your decision. You can also cancel the preview and go back to the Board Selection. When you've selected the Boards you want to use, it's time to plan out your path through the connected Boards. This step is all about maximizing efficiency; we want to get the most possible desirable nodes into our board within the allotted points while also prioritizing the very best ones. To accomplish this, we need to employ several strategies. We do this for every board, starting from highest priority to lowest, until we've exhausted all of our points and cannot find a more optimal path that maximizes the amount of desired nodes we can pick up. The first thing we want to accomplish is finding the shortest route through each of our boards that still picks up all of the major nodes we want.  This is usually accomplished by taking the most direct path to each node, starting with the node closest to the entrance to the board first and ending with the node closest to the exit. Nodes in between these two can be trickier, but you can generally move to the next closest until you reach the exit. Due to the way some boards are set up, it may make more sense to branch out to access a valuable node or cluster and then go back to a previous one to continue on the path. Speaking of the exit, when possible always choose the one that is closest to a node that you can end with. This will save you several points that you can use elsewhere. Boards have 4 different connection points, and the orientation of each Board is not static. They can be rotated 90 degrees, which allows you to connect a Board from any point. Use this to your advantage to create the shortest possible path and avoid wasting points. Having the ability to rotate your boards also means you don't have to worry about which connection point you end at, since the next Board can be reoriented to accommodate the connection point. The only exception to this is if the ending point on the Board would lead you back into a previously established board, preventing a connection to a new board. Sometimes a Board will have multiple valuable nodes on it that are very far away from each other, and the stuff in between provides little additional value. In these cases, it may be better to jump into a Board multiple times. In this scenario, we would enter a Board near a valuable node and then immediately move on to the nearest exit node. We would then set up the rest of our boards in a way that could circle back to the other side of the Board with the far away nodes. This only works if we have enough additional boards to invest in and naturally want the points in them. It can take a lot of planning to pull off, but success can mean saving several points to spend in more valuable areas. Early on you simply focus on rushing to specific nodes that empowers your character. Later on, this can be optimized as we have an abundance of Paragon Points to use in the endgame. A strategic Paragon Board reset is utilized by builds that benefits from a specific route early on, but once you have progressed further in the build can change for something more optimal. This is communicated in our build guides with the Paragon Board progression slider, where one step features a completely new layout compared to the previous one. Glyphs are a powerful addition to further enhance your character after reaching Level 60. They are rune-like items that are placed in special Socket Nodes on each board. These glyphs can be leveled in , but to understand how to utilize these powerful additions to your endgame power, lets elaborate what a Glyph is and where you can find them. A Paragon Glyph is your way of empowering your endgame build further through powerful effects such as increased damage dealt versus enemies, or gaining more energy after using an agility skill. These customizations puts your build apart from others and allows your character to grow stronger the further you progress in . To fully understand how a Glyph is structured and functions, let us look into For example, grants +3.0% increased Lightning damage for every 5 Dexterity allocated in range. The additional bonus requires you to reach 25 Dexterity on allocated Paragon Nodes in its Radius. You should put this into a Glyph Socket that has as much Dexterity in range as possible. Once the Glyph reaches level 46, it becomes and gains an additional radius increase to its maximum of 5. This increase is extremely powerful as it gives you access to a new Legendary Bonus multiplier at the bottom of the Glyph. To use a Glyph, you have to place it into a Socket Node on your Paragon Board. Each board has one of these Nodes. Every Glyph has a \"base bonus\" that applies to your character when socketed. Glyphs have an additional bonus that is unlocked when the specified Attribute from allocated Paragon Nodes is reached. Make sure to unlock these secondary bonuses! Obtaining these powerful Glyphs is easy, but may take a while to obtain before having the full set you require for your build. Once you hit level 60, any activity has a chance of dropping a Glyph for you. The best way, as you could guess, is to run . You can open your Paragon Board and check for the ones you have obtained and which have not yet been found. They can look very similar to regular items when dropped, so be on the lookout to not miss any. Players who manage to clear the entire pit and slay the boss before the timer runs out can upgrade their glyphs. If you successfully clear the pit, you gain: Depending on the difficulty of the pit, the odds of successfully upgrading your glyph increase based on the level difference between the glyph and the pit run. This chance is 100% if the Pit level is 10 levels ahead of the Glyph, with reduced effectiveness if the Pit level is closer to the Glyph's level. If the level difference between your glyph and the Pit level is greater than 20, your glyph gets an additional upgrade. The max level of glyphs has been increased from level 21 to level 100. Once you reach Glyph level 45, it costs 10k gem fragments to upgrade from quality, giving it an additional radius size and a new affix. Maintained by"

Be sure the bonus they provide works with your build prior to selecting them to not waste points. Nodes that are near are especially valuable to either increase a Glyph's power or when the placed Glyph increases Nodes' power in its Radius. These Nodes have a significant impact on your character's build. They are especially powerful while leveling up. consist of 2 Attributes and a Bonus that needs to be unlocked. To do so, your character must meet the minimum Attribute requirement stated on the Node. This requirement consists of one or two Attributes. When you attach multiple Paragon Boards, the thresholds for those Bonuses increase, making them more difficult to unlock. requires both Intelligence and Willpower. The base Node grants 14% Core Skill Damage and 35% Basic Skill Damage. When both requirements are met, the Core Skill Value doubles to 28% and the line turns green to indicate that the Bonus is unlocked. These are the flashy orange nodes that the entire Board is designed around and named after. Because of this, many players assume they are also the most important nodes on the Board, and this is often the case. However, the other options we cover below can be just as important or more, so don't just assume that the is all that matters! Consider all of the important nodes on a Board before committing. If two Nodes are similar in power, a good node or well-placed Glyph socket may be the difference. One important factor to bear in mind is that offensive nodes provide multiplicative damage, which makes them even more powerful than they may seem. If it fits really well with your build, then it should be factored heavily in your decision to use the board. Glyph sockets are the most complex of all the nodes and will require the most thought and planning to get the most out of. Glyphs are acquired as drops and can be placed in these special sockets. Each Glyph has an effect that either improves the power of nearby nodes or draws power from nearby nodes to grant a special effect. Make sure to read the description carefully to understand how to maximize these benefits Once you understand the benefits, the biggest factor for your board is determining what sockets will be most beneficial to the Glyphs you want to use.  For example, a Glyph that provides a bonus to nodes within range should be used in a socket that has the most impactful nodes nearby so that you get the most benefit. A Glyph that gets stronger from selecting nodes with a certain attribute will want to be in a socket that has the most density for that attribute within range. To attach a new Paragon Board, you have to reach something called a Board Attachment Gate. These Nodes connect one Paragon Board to another one. Every board contains four Board Attachment Gates in the center of the four board edges. One is used to enter the board, the other three can be used to connect the next board. They also grant +5 to all Attributes. Since you won't be able to invest in every board, you need to choose the best and leave the rest. How you choose those is going to vary somewhat from build to build, but here's some general rules to follow: Paragon Points are a limited resource. There are only three ways to gain them: When you complete all of these objectives, you gain up to 327 Paragon Points. These Paragon Points are used to path across the Paragon Boards and reach the various Paragon Nodes across them. When you reach a Board Attachment Gate, you have the option to select your next Paragon Board. Every class has 8 unique Paragon Boards to choose from.

Because of this, many players assume they are also the most important nodes on the Board, and this is often the case. However, the other options we cover below can be just as important or more, so don't just assume that the is all that matters! Consider all of the important nodes on a Board before committing. If two Nodes are similar in power, a good node or well-placed Glyph socket may be the difference. One important factor to bear in mind is that offensive nodes provide multiplicative damage, which makes them even more powerful than they may seem. If it fits really well with your build, then it should be factored heavily in your decision to use the board. Glyph sockets are the most complex of all the nodes and will require the most thought and planning to get the most out of. Glyphs are acquired as drops and can be placed in these special sockets. Each Glyph has an effect that either improves the power of nearby nodes or draws power from nearby nodes to grant a special effect. Make sure to read the description carefully to understand how to maximize these benefits Once you understand the benefits, the biggest factor for your board is determining what sockets will be most beneficial to the Glyphs you want to use.  For example, a Glyph that provides a bonus to nodes within range should be used in a socket that has the most impactful nodes nearby so that you get the most benefit. A Glyph that gets stronger from selecting nodes with a certain attribute will want to be in a socket that has the most density for that attribute within range. To attach a new Paragon Board, you have to reach something called a Board Attachment Gate. These Nodes connect one Paragon Board to another one. Every board contains four Board Attachment Gates in the center of the four board edges. One is used to enter the board, the other three can be used to connect the next board. They also grant +5 to all Attributes. Since you won't be able to invest in every board, you need to choose the best and leave the rest. How you choose those is going to vary somewhat from build to build, but here's some general rules to follow: Paragon Points are a limited resource. There are only three ways to gain them: When you complete all of these objectives, you gain up to 327 Paragon Points. These Paragon Points are used to path across the Paragon Boards and reach the various Paragon Nodes across them. When you reach a Board Attachment Gate, you have the option to select your next Paragon Board. Every class has 8 unique Paragon Boards to choose from. As of Season 6, you can have a maximum of 5 boards including the starting board. Initially, you get an overview of each board's Nodes. Each board has a specific theme, for example, the board focuses on the Imbuement Skills of the Rogue. When you hit the \"Preview\" button, the Board Preview Mode shows up. Here you can see the layout of the selected board and rotate it in 90° steps, allowing you to optimize your path through it. When you are happy with the board and its rotation, you hit the \"Attach Board\" button to finalize your decision. You can also cancel the preview and go back to the Board Selection. When you've selected the Boards you want to use, it's time to plan out your path through the connected Boards. This step is all about maximizing efficiency; we want to get the most possible desirable nodes into our board within the allotted points while also prioritizing the very best ones. To accomplish this, we need to employ several strategies. We do this for every board, starting from highest priority to lowest, until we've exhausted all of our points and cannot find a more optimal path that maximizes the amount of desired nodes we can pick up. The first thing we want to accomplish is finding the shortest route through each of our boards that still picks up all of the major nodes we want.  This is usually accomplished by taking the most direct path to each node, starting with the node closest to the entrance to the board first and ending with the node closest to the exit. Nodes in between these two can be trickier, but you can generally move to the next closest until you reach the exit. Due to the way some boards are set up, it may make more sense to branch out to access a valuable node or cluster and then go back to a previous one to continue on the path. Speaking of the exit, when possible always choose the one that is closest to a node that you can end with. This will save you several points that you can use elsewhere. Boards have 4 different connection points, and the orientation of each Board is not static. They can be rotated 90 degrees, which allows you to connect a Board from any point. Use this to your advantage to create the shortest possible path and avoid wasting points. Having the ability to rotate your boards also means you don't have to worry about which connection point you end at, since the next Board can be reoriented to accommodate the connection point. The only exception to this is if the ending point on the Board would lead you back into a previously established board, preventing a connection to a new board. Sometimes a Board will have multiple valuable nodes on it that are very far away from each other, and the stuff in between provides little additional value. In these cases, it may be better to jump into a Board multiple times. In this scenario, we would enter a Board near a valuable node and then immediately move on to the nearest exit node. We would then set up the rest of our boards in a way that could circle back to the other side of the Board with the far away nodes. This only works if we have enough additional boards to invest in and naturally want the points in them. It can take a lot of planning to pull off, but success can mean saving several points to spend in more valuable areas. Early on you simply focus on rushing to specific nodes that empowers your character. Later on, this can be optimized as we have an abundance of Paragon Points to use in the endgame. A strategic Paragon Board reset is utilized by builds that benefits from a specific route early on, but once you have progressed further in the build can change for something more optimal. This is communicated in our build guides with the Paragon Board progression slider, where one step features a completely new layout compared to the previous one. Glyphs are a powerful addition to further enhance your character after reaching Level 60. They are rune-like items that are placed in special Socket Nodes on each board. These glyphs can be leveled in , but to understand how to utilize these powerful additions to your endgame power, lets elaborate what a Glyph is and where you can find them. A Paragon Glyph is your way of empowering your endgame build further through powerful effects such as increased damage dealt versus enemies, or gaining more energy after using an agility skill. These customizations puts your build apart from others and allows your character to grow stronger the further you progress in . To fully understand how a Glyph is structured and functions, let us look into For example, grants +3.0% increased Lightning damage for every 5 Dexterity allocated in range. The additional bonus requires you to reach 25 Dexterity on allocated Paragon Nodes in its Radius. You should put this into a Glyph Socket that has as much Dexterity in range as possible. Once the Glyph reaches level 46, it becomes and gains an additional radius increase to its maximum of 5. This increase is extremely powerful as it gives you access to a new Legendary Bonus multiplier at the bottom of the Glyph. To use a Glyph, you have to place it into a Socket Node on your Paragon Board. Each board has one of these Nodes. Every Glyph has a \"base bonus\" that applies to your character when socketed. Glyphs have an additional bonus that is unlocked when the specified Attribute from allocated Paragon Nodes is reached. Make sure to unlock these secondary bonuses! Obtaining these powerful Glyphs is easy, but may take a while to obtain before having the full set you require for your build. Once you hit level 60, any activity has a chance of dropping a Glyph for you. The best way, as you could guess, is to run . You can open your Paragon Board and check for the ones you have obtained and which have not yet been found. They can look very similar to regular items when dropped, so be on the lookout to not miss any.

Sometimes a Board will have multiple valuable nodes on it that are very far away from each other, and the stuff in between provides little additional value. In these cases, it may be better to jump into a Board multiple times. In this scenario, we would enter a Board near a valuable node and then immediately move on to the nearest exit node. We would then set up the rest of our boards in a way that could circle back to the other side of the Board with the far away nodes. This only works if we have enough additional boards to invest in and naturally want the points in them. It can take a lot of planning to pull off, but success can mean saving several points to spend in more valuable areas. Early on you simply focus on rushing to specific nodes that empowers your character. Later on, this can be optimized as we have an abundance of Paragon Points to use in the endgame. A strategic Paragon Board reset is utilized by builds that benefits from a specific route early on, but once you have progressed further in the build can change for something more optimal. This is communicated in our build guides with the Paragon Board progression slider, where one step features a completely new layout compared to the previous one. Glyphs are a powerful addition to further enhance your character after reaching Level 60. They are rune-like items that are placed in special Socket Nodes on each board. These glyphs can be leveled in , but to understand how to utilize these powerful additions to your endgame power, lets elaborate what a Glyph is and where you can find them. A Paragon Glyph is your way of empowering your endgame build further through powerful effects such as increased damage dealt versus enemies, or gaining more energy after using an agility skill. These customizations puts your build apart from others and allows your character to grow stronger the further you progress in . To fully understand how a Glyph is structured and functions, let us look into For example, grants +3.0% increased Lightning damage for every 5 Dexterity allocated in range. The additional bonus requires you to reach 25 Dexterity on allocated Paragon Nodes in its Radius. You should put this into a Glyph Socket that has as much Dexterity in range as possible. Once the Glyph reaches level 46, it becomes and gains an additional radius increase to its maximum of 5. This increase is extremely powerful as it gives you access to a new Legendary Bonus multiplier at the bottom of the Glyph. To use a Glyph, you have to place it into a Socket Node on your Paragon Board. Each board has one of these Nodes. Every Glyph has a \"base bonus\" that applies to your character when socketed. Glyphs have an additional bonus that is unlocked when the specified Attribute from allocated Paragon Nodes is reached. Make sure to unlock these secondary bonuses! Obtaining these powerful Glyphs is easy, but may take a while to obtain before having the full set you require for your build. Once you hit level 60, any activity has a chance of dropping a Glyph for you. The best way, as you could guess, is to run . You can open your Paragon Board and check for the ones you have obtained and which have not yet been found. They can look very similar to regular items when dropped, so be on the lookout to not miss any. Players who manage to clear the entire pit and slay the boss before the timer runs out can upgrade their glyphs. If you successfully clear the pit, you gain: Depending on the difficulty of the pit, the odds of successfully upgrading your glyph increase based on the level difference between the glyph and the pit run. This chance is 100% if the Pit level is 10 levels ahead of the Glyph, with reduced effectiveness if the Pit level is closer to the Glyph's level. If the level difference between your glyph and the Pit level is greater than 20, your glyph gets an additional upgrade. The max level of glyphs has been increased from level 21 to level 100. Once you reach Glyph level 45, it costs 10k gem fragments to upgrade from quality, giving it an additional radius size and a new affix. Maintained by"

    "content": "These are the flashy orange nodes that the entire Board is designed around and named after. Because of this, many players assume they are also the most important nodes on the Board, and this is often the case. However, the other options we cover below can be just as important or more, so don't just assume that the is all that matters! Consider all of the important nodes on a Board before committing. If two Nodes are similar in power, a good node or well-placed Glyph socket may be the difference. One important factor to bear in mind is that offensive nodes provide multiplicative damage, which makes them even more powerful than they may seem. If it fits really well with your build, then it should be factored heavily in your decision to use the board. Glyph sockets are the most complex of all the nodes and will require the most thought and planning to get the most out of. Glyphs are acquired as drops and can be placed in these special sockets. Each Glyph has an effect that either improves the power of nearby nodes or draws power from nearby nodes to grant a special effect. Make sure to read the description carefully to understand how to maximize these benefits Once you understand the benefits, the biggest factor for your board is determining what sockets will be most beneficial to the Glyphs you want to use.  For example, a Glyph that provides a bonus to nodes within range should be used in a socket that has the most impactful nodes nearby so that you get the most benefit. A Glyph that gets stronger from selecting nodes with a certain attribute will want to be in a socket that has the most density for that attribute within range. To attach a new Paragon Board, you have to reach something called a Board Attachment Gate. These Nodes connect one Paragon Board to another one. Every board contains four Board Attachment Gates in the center of the four board edges. One is used to enter the board, the other three can be used to connect the next board. They also grant +5 to all Attributes. Since you won't be able to invest in every board, you need to choose the best and leave the rest. How you choose those is going to vary somewhat from build to build, but here's some general rules to follow: Paragon Points are a limited resource. There are only three ways to gain them: When you complete all of these objectives, you gain up to 327 Paragon Points. These Paragon Points are used to path across the Paragon Boards and reach the various Paragon Nodes across them. When you reach a Board Attachment Gate, you have the option to select your next Paragon Board. Every class has 8 unique Paragon Boards to choose from. As of Season 6, you can have a maximum of 5 boards including the starting board. Initially, you get an overview of each board's Nodes. Each board has a specific theme, for example, the board focuses on the Imbuement Skills of the Rogue. When you hit the \"Preview\" button, the Board Preview Mode shows up. Here you can see the layout of the selected board and rotate it in 90° steps, allowing you to optimize your path through it. When you are happy with the board and its rotation, you hit the \"Attach Board\" button to finalize your decision. You can also cancel the preview and go back to the Board Selection. When you've selected the Boards you want to use, it's time to plan out your path through the connected Boards. This step is all about maximizing efficiency; we want to get the most possible desirable nodes into our board within the allotted points while also prioritizing the very best ones. To accomplish this, we need to employ several strategies. We do this for every board, starting from highest priority to lowest, until we've exhausted all of our points and cannot find a more optimal path that maximizes the amount of desired nodes we can pick up. The first thing we want to accomplish is finding the shortest route through each of our boards that still picks up all of the major nodes we want.  This is usually accomplished by taking the most direct path to each node, starting with the node closest to the entrance to the board first and ending with the node closest to the exit. Nodes in between these two can be trickier, but you can generally move to the next closest until you reach the exit. Due to the way some boards are set up, it may make more sense to branch out to access a valuable node or cluster and then go back to a previous one to continue on the path. Speaking of the exit, when possible always choose the one that is closest to a node that you can end with. This will save you several points that you can use elsewhere. Boards have 4 different connection points, and the orientation of each Board is not static. They can be rotated 90 degrees, which allows you to connect a Board from any point. Use this to your advantage to create the shortest possible path and avoid wasting points.

Sometimes a Board will have multiple valuable nodes on it that are very far away from each other, and the stuff in between provides little additional value. In these cases, it may be better to jump into a Board multiple times. In this scenario, we would enter a Board near a valuable node and then immediately move on to the nearest exit node. We would then set up the rest of our boards in a way that could circle back to the other side of the Board with the far away nodes. This only works if we have enough additional boards to invest in and naturally want the points in them. It can take a lot of planning to pull off, but success can mean saving several points to spend in more valuable areas. Early on you simply focus on rushing to specific nodes that empowers your character. Later on, this can be optimized as we have an abundance of Paragon Points to use in the endgame. A strategic Paragon Board reset is utilized by builds that benefits from a specific route early on, but once you have progressed further in the build can change for something more optimal. This is communicated in our build guides with the Paragon Board progression slider, where one step features a completely new layout compared to the previous one. Glyphs are a powerful addition to further enhance your character after reaching Level 60. They are rune-like items that are placed in special Socket Nodes on each board. These glyphs can be leveled in , but to understand how to utilize these powerful additions to your endgame power, lets elaborate what a Glyph is and where you can find them. A Paragon Glyph is your way of empowering your endgame build further through powerful effects such as increased damage dealt versus enemies, or gaining more energy after using an agility skill. These customizations puts your build apart from others and allows your character to grow stronger the further you progress in . To fully understand how a Glyph is structured and functions, let us look into For example, grants +3.0% increased Lightning damage for every 5 Dexterity allocated in range. The additional bonus requires you to reach 25 Dexterity on allocated Paragon Nodes in its Radius. You should put this into a Glyph Socket that has as much Dexterity in range as possible. Once the Glyph reaches level 46, it becomes and gains an additional radius increase to its maximum of 5. This increase is extremely powerful as it gives you access to a new Legendary Bonus multiplier at the bottom of the Glyph. To use a Glyph, you have to place it into a Socket Node on your Paragon Board. Each board has one of these Nodes. Every Glyph has a \"base bonus\" that applies to your character when socketed. Glyphs have an additional bonus that is unlocked when the specified Attribute from allocated Paragon Nodes is reached. Make sure to unlock these secondary bonuses! Obtaining these powerful Glyphs is easy, but may take a while to obtain before having the full set you require for your build. Once you hit level 60, any activity has a chance of dropping a Glyph for you. The best way, as you could guess, is to run . You can open your Paragon Board and check for the ones you have obtained and which have not yet been found. They can look very similar to regular items when dropped, so be on the lookout to not miss any. Players who manage to clear the entire pit and slay the boss before the timer runs out can upgrade their glyphs. If you successfully clear the pit, you gain: Depending on the difficulty of the pit, the odds of successfully upgrading your glyph increase based on the level difference between the glyph and the pit run. This chance is 100% if the Pit level is 10 levels ahead of the Glyph, with reduced effectiveness if the Pit level is closer to the Glyph's level. If the level difference between your glyph and the Pit level is greater than 20, your glyph gets an additional upgrade. The max level of glyphs has been increased from level 21 to level 100. Once you reach Glyph level 45, it costs 10k gem fragments to upgrade from quality, giving it an additional radius size and a new affix. Maintained by"

    "content": "One important factor to bear in mind is that offensive nodes provide multiplicative damage, which makes them even more powerful than they may seem. If it fits really well with your build, then it should be factored heavily in your decision to use the board. Glyph sockets are the most complex of all the nodes and will require the most thought and planning to get the most out of. Glyphs are acquired as drops and can be placed in these special sockets. Each Glyph has an effect that either improves the power of nearby nodes or draws power from nearby nodes to grant a special effect. Make sure to read the description carefully to understand how to maximize these benefits Once you understand the benefits, the biggest factor for your board is determining what sockets will be most beneficial to the Glyphs you want to use.  For example, a Glyph that provides a bonus to nodes within range should be used in a socket that has the most impactful nodes nearby so that you get the most benefit. A Glyph that gets stronger from selecting nodes with a certain attribute will want to be in a socket that has the most density for that attribute within range. To attach a new Paragon Board, you have to reach something called a Board Attachment Gate. These Nodes connect one Paragon Board to another one. Every board contains four Board Attachment Gates in the center of the four board edges. One is used to enter the board, the other three can be used to connect the next board. They also grant +5 to all Attributes. Since you won't be able to invest in every board, you need to choose the best and leave the rest. How you choose those is going to vary somewhat from build to build, but here's some general rules to follow: Paragon Points are a limited resource. There are only three ways to gain them: When you complete all of these objectives, you gain up to 327 Paragon Points. These Paragon Points are used to path across the Paragon Boards and reach the various Paragon Nodes across them. When you reach a Board Attachment Gate, you have the option to select your next Paragon Board. Every class has 8 unique Paragon Boards to choose from. As of Season 6, you can have a maximum of 5 boards including the starting board. Initially, you get an overview of each board's Nodes. Each board has a specific theme, for example, the board focuses on the Imbuement Skills of the Rogue. When you hit the \"Preview\" button, the Board Preview Mode shows up. Here you can see the layout of the selected board and rotate it in 90° steps, allowing you to optimize your path through it. When you are happy with the board and its rotation, you hit the \"Attach Board\" button to finalize your decision. You can also cancel the preview and go back to the Board Selection. When you've selected the Boards you want to use, it's time to plan out your path through the connected Boards. This step is all about maximizing efficiency; we want to get the most possible desirable nodes into our board within the allotted points while also prioritizing the very best ones. To accomplish this, we need to employ several strategies. We do this for every board, starting from highest priority to lowest, until we've exhausted all of our points and cannot find a more optimal path that maximizes the amount of desired nodes we can pick up. The first thing we want to accomplish is finding the shortest route through each of our boards that still picks up all of the major nodes we want.  This is usually accomplished by taking the most direct path to each node, starting with the node closest to the entrance to the board first and ending with the node closest to the exit. Nodes in between these two can be trickier, but you can generally move to the next closest until you reach the exit. Due to the way some boards are set up, it may make more sense to branch out to access a valuable node or cluster and then go back to a previous one to continue on the path. Speaking of the exit, when possible always choose the one that is closest to a node that you can end with. This will save you several points that you can use elsewhere. Boards have 4 different connection points, and the orientation of each Board is not static. They can be rotated 90 degrees, which allows you to connect a Board from any point. Use this to your advantage to create the shortest possible path and avoid wasting points.

To fully understand how a Glyph is structured and functions, let us look into For example, grants +3.0% increased Lightning damage for every 5 Dexterity allocated in range. The additional bonus requires you to reach 25 Dexterity on allocated Paragon Nodes in its Radius. You should put this into a Glyph Socket that has as much Dexterity in range as possible. Once the Glyph reaches level 46, it becomes and gains an additional radius increase to its maximum of 5. This increase is extremely powerful as it gives you access to a new Legendary Bonus multiplier at the bottom of the Glyph. To use a Glyph, you have to place it into a Socket Node on your Paragon Board. Each board has one of these Nodes. Every Glyph has a \"base bonus\" that applies to your character when socketed. Glyphs have an additional bonus that is unlocked when the specified Attribute from allocated Paragon Nodes is reached. Make sure to unlock these secondary bonuses! Obtaining these powerful Glyphs is easy, but may take a while to obtain before having the full set you require for your build. Once you hit level 60, any activity has a chance of dropping a Glyph for you. The best way, as you could guess, is to run . You can open your Paragon Board and check for the ones you have obtained and which have not yet been found. They can look very similar to regular items when dropped, so be on the lookout to not miss any. Players who manage to clear the entire pit and slay the boss before the timer runs out can upgrade their glyphs. If you successfully clear the pit, you gain: Depending on the difficulty of the pit, the odds of successfully upgrading your glyph increase based on the level difference between the glyph and the pit run. This chance is 100% if the Pit level is 10 levels ahead of the Glyph, with reduced effectiveness if the Pit level is closer to the Glyph's level. If the level difference between your glyph and the Pit level is greater than 20, your glyph gets an additional upgrade. The max level of glyphs has been increased from level 21 to level 100. Once you reach Glyph level 45, it costs 10k gem fragments to upgrade from quality, giving it an additional radius size and a new affix. Maintained by"

    "content": "Once you understand the benefits, the biggest factor for your board is determining what sockets will be most beneficial to the Glyphs you want to use.  For example, a Glyph that provides a bonus to nodes within range should be used in a socket that has the most impactful nodes nearby so that you get the most benefit. A Glyph that gets stronger from selecting nodes with a certain attribute will want to be in a socket that has the most density for that attribute within range. To attach a new Paragon Board, you have to reach something called a Board Attachment Gate. These Nodes connect one Paragon Board to another one. Every board contains four Board Attachment Gates in the center of the four board edges. One is used to enter the board, the other three can be used to connect the next board. They also grant +5 to all Attributes. Since you won't be able to invest in every board, you need to choose the best and leave the rest. How you choose those is going to vary somewhat from build to build, but here's some general rules to follow: Paragon Points are a limited resource. There are only three ways to gain them: When you complete all of these objectives, you gain up to 327 Paragon Points. These Paragon Points are used to path across the Paragon Boards and reach the various Paragon Nodes across them. When you reach a Board Attachment Gate, you have the option to select your next Paragon Board. Every class has 8 unique Paragon Boards to choose from. As of Season 6, you can have a maximum of 5 boards including the starting board. Initially, you get an overview of each board's Nodes. Each board has a specific theme, for example, the board focuses on the Imbuement Skills of the Rogue. When you hit the \"Preview\" button, the Board Preview Mode shows up. Here you can see the layout of the selected board and rotate it in 90° steps, allowing you to optimize your path through it. When you are happy with the board and its rotation, you hit the \"Attach Board\" button to finalize your decision. You can also cancel the preview and go back to the Board Selection. When you've selected the Boards you want to use, it's time to plan out your path through the connected Boards. This step is all about maximizing efficiency; we want to get the most possible desirable nodes into our board within the allotted points while also prioritizing the very best ones. To accomplish this, we need to employ several strategies. We do this for every board, starting from highest priority to lowest, until we've exhausted all of our points and cannot find a more optimal path that maximizes the amount of desired nodes we can pick up. The first thing we want to accomplish is finding the shortest route through each of our boards that still picks up all of the major nodes we want.  This is usually accomplished by taking the most direct path to each node, starting with the node closest to the entrance to the board first and ending with the node closest to the exit. Nodes in between these two can be trickier, but you can generally move to the next closest until you reach the exit. Due to the way some boards are set up, it may make more sense to branch out to access a valuable node or cluster and then go back to a previous one to continue on the path. Speaking of the exit, when possible always choose the one that is closest to a node that you can end with. This will save you several points that you can use elsewhere. Boards have 4 different connection points, and the orientation of each Board is not static. They can be rotated 90 degrees, which allows you to connect a Board from any point. Use this to your advantage to create the shortest possible path and avoid wasting points. Having the ability to rotate your boards also means you don't have to worry about which connection point you end at, since the next Board can be reoriented to accommodate the connection point. The only exception to this is if the ending point on the Board would lead you back into a previously established board, preventing a connection to a new board. Sometimes a Board will have multiple valuable nodes on it that are very far away from each other, and the stuff in between provides little additional value. In these cases, it may be better to jump into a Board multiple times. In this scenario, we would enter a Board near a valuable node and then immediately move on to the nearest exit node. We would then set up the rest of our boards in a way that could circle back to the other side of the Board with the far away nodes. This only works if we have enough additional boards to invest in and naturally want the points in them. It can take a lot of planning to pull off, but success can mean saving several points to spend in more valuable areas. Early on you simply focus on rushing to specific nodes that empowers your character. Later on, this can be optimized as we have an abundance of Paragon Points to use in the endgame. A strategic Paragon Board reset is utilized by builds that benefits from a specific route early on, but once you have progressed further in the build can change for something more optimal. This is communicated in our build guides with the Paragon Board progression slider, where one step features a completely new layout compared to the previous one. Glyphs are a powerful addition to further enhance your character after reaching Level 60. They are rune-like items that are placed in special Socket Nodes on each board.

The first thing we want to accomplish is finding the shortest route through each of our boards that still picks up all of the major nodes we want.  This is usually accomplished by taking the most direct path to each node, starting with the node closest to the entrance to the board first and ending with the node closest to the exit. Nodes in between these two can be trickier, but you can generally move to the next closest until you reach the exit. Due to the way some boards are set up, it may make more sense to branch out to access a valuable node or cluster and then go back to a previous one to continue on the path. Speaking of the exit, when possible always choose the one that is closest to a node that you can end with. This will save you several points that you can use elsewhere. Boards have 4 different connection points, and the orientation of each Board is not static. They can be rotated 90 degrees, which allows you to connect a Board from any point. Use this to your advantage to create the shortest possible path and avoid wasting points. Having the ability to rotate your boards also means you don't have to worry about which connection point you end at, since the next Board can be reoriented to accommodate the connection point. The only exception to this is if the ending point on the Board would lead you back into a previously established board, preventing a connection to a new board. Sometimes a Board will have multiple valuable nodes on it that are very far away from each other, and the stuff in between provides little additional value. In these cases, it may be better to jump into a Board multiple times. In this scenario, we would enter a Board near a valuable node and then immediately move on to the nearest exit node. We would then set up the rest of our boards in a way that could circle back to the other side of the Board with the far away nodes. This only works if we have enough additional boards to invest in and naturally want the points in them. It can take a lot of planning to pull off, but success can mean saving several points to spend in more valuable areas. Early on you simply focus on rushing to specific nodes that empowers your character. Later on, this can be optimized as we have an abundance of Paragon Points to use in the endgame. A strategic Paragon Board reset is utilized by builds that benefits from a specific route early on, but once you have progressed further in the build can change for something more optimal. This is communicated in our build guides with the Paragon Board progression slider, where one step features a completely new layout compared to the previous one. Glyphs are a powerful addition to further enhance your character after reaching Level 60. They are rune-like items that are placed in special Socket Nodes on each board. These glyphs can be leveled in , but to understand how to utilize these powerful additions to your endgame power, lets elaborate what a Glyph is and where you can find them. A Paragon Glyph is your way of empowering your endgame build further through powerful effects such as increased damage dealt versus enemies, or gaining more energy after using an agility skill. These customizations puts your build apart from others and allows your character to grow stronger the further you progress in . To fully understand how a Glyph is structured and functions, let us look into For example, grants +3.0% increased Lightning damage for every 5 Dexterity allocated in range. The additional bonus requires you to reach 25 Dexterity on allocated Paragon Nodes in its Radius. You should put this into a Glyph Socket that has as much Dexterity in range as possible. Once the Glyph reaches level 46, it becomes and gains an additional radius increase to its maximum of 5. This increase is extremely powerful as it gives you access to a new Legendary Bonus multiplier at the bottom of the Glyph. To use a Glyph, you have to place it into a Socket Node on your Paragon Board. Each board has one of these Nodes. Every Glyph has a \"base bonus\" that applies to your character when socketed. Glyphs have an additional bonus that is unlocked when the specified Attribute from allocated Paragon Nodes is reached. Make sure to unlock these secondary bonuses! Obtaining these powerful Glyphs is easy, but may take a while to obtain before having the full set you require for your build. Once you hit level 60, any activity has a chance of dropping a Glyph for you. The best way, as you could guess, is to run . You can open your Paragon Board and check for the ones you have obtained and which have not yet been found. They can look very similar to regular items when dropped, so be on the lookout to not miss any. Players who manage to clear the entire pit and slay the boss before the timer runs out can upgrade their glyphs. If you successfully clear the pit, you gain: Depending on the difficulty of the pit, the odds of successfully upgrading your glyph increase based on the level difference between the glyph and the pit run. This chance is 100% if the Pit level is 10 levels ahead of the Glyph, with reduced effectiveness if the Pit level is closer to the Glyph's level. If the level difference between your glyph and the Pit level is greater than 20, your glyph gets an additional upgrade. The max level of glyphs has been increased from level 21 to level 100. Once you reach Glyph level 45, it costs 10k gem fragments to upgrade from quality, giving it an additional radius size and a new affix. Maintained by"

These Paragon Points are used to path across the Paragon Boards and reach the various Paragon Nodes across them. When you reach a Board Attachment Gate, you have the option to select your next Paragon Board. Every class has 8 unique Paragon Boards to choose from. As of Season 6, you can have a maximum of 5 boards including the starting board. Initially, you get an overview of each board's Nodes. Each board has a specific theme, for example, the board focuses on the Imbuement Skills of the Rogue. When you hit the \"Preview\" button, the Board Preview Mode shows up. Here you can see the layout of the selected board and rotate it in 90° steps, allowing you to optimize your path through it. When you are happy with the board and its rotation, you hit the \"Attach Board\" button to finalize your decision. You can also cancel the preview and go back to the Board Selection. When you've selected the Boards you want to use, it's time to plan out your path through the connected Boards.
