    "heading": "Elites and Affixes Overview",
    "content": "Elites are more powerful enemies that can randomly spawn anywhere you encounter regular monsters in Diablo 4. They have higher health, damage, and come with a range of possible Elite Affixes. Affixes are extra abilities cast by Elites that make combat more engaging, requiring you to outplay them. In the World of Sanctuary, normal monsters without a doubt are just not getting the job done. In response, they call forth a threat that's considerably stronger than the average corrupt you just trampled over. They will stop at nothing to finish the job their underlings could not. Armed with many different affixes designed to torture you, make your life miserable, or outright kill you, these are dangerous adversaries that should not be underestimated. Don't worry though, we got you covered. It should also be noted Elites can be highly rewarding. Elites have a chance at a \"Jackpot\" effect, dropping a lot of a particular material. Crafting materials, , and even a chance of obtaining a random Boss Summoning Material can all be yours! We have studied these affixes carefully, and have compiled a complete list of possible threats as well as how they function so that you are never caught off guard traversing the World of Sanctuary. Let us begin! These elemental Elite Affixes look to maximize zone coverage to slow you down in any way possible. These elemental Elite Affixes are pretty straight forward. They deal huge burst damage. These elemental Elite Affixes deal quick small tick damage across a wide area. These elemental Elite Affixes deal damage over time. Shown as green in your health globe, taking poison damage gradually decreases your life. These elemental affixes are looking to make you lose control and blind you from the battlefield. These are Elite Affixes that are more crowd control and defense based with no elemental damage attached. Elites can spawn with Minions that are also considered but don't inherit their affixes. Instead, they simply have increased Life values. Always pay attention to what you are up against and don't fret if you don't succeed every time. You have plenty of time to practice throughout your journey. See you in Sanctuary! Reviewed by"
