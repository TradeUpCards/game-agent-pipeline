Click the accordion below to see what materials you need to Masterwork your gear. equipment can be masterworked to rank 8, while Ancestral can be masterworked to rank 12. Increasing the Masterworking Rank of equipment increases all affixes by 5%. However, at Masterworking Rank 4, Rank 8, and Rank 12, only one of the item's affixes receives a bonus, but the bonus is 25% instead of 5%. This more significant bonus is called \"critting\" an Affix and is referred to as an MW: Crit for the rest of this guide. All Masterworking bonuses and the 50% bonus from a Greater Affix are additive to each other. To use a practical example, an affix with GA and upgraded to rank 6/12 with one MW: Crit would be increased by . Affixes with whole-number values are rounded down after their bonuses are applied. A single affix can receive the MW: Crit bonus multiple times. Affixes that receive this bonus once are , twice are , and three times are . At Rank 12, an item has a guaranteed total of 45% (5% times 9 upgrades between 1-3, 5-7, and 9-11). This means that a Rank 12 Affix would have the following total bonus, depending on how many times it received a MW: Crit: as our example, it has the following base stats: At Masterworking 12/12, we would expect these stats to increase in the following way: However, as we can see, the last part is not following the expected formula. The expected result would have been +4 ranks to Core Skills, but we ended up with +5. This is something called the \"30% rule\" in the community. This is covered in the section below. Masterworking has a specific pattern for increasing skill ranks based on MW: Crits and GA rolls on the item. The pattern may seem random, but it is consistent across all skills, whether the item is a amulet, skill ranks on gloves, or even items! You get a skill rank each time you reach a 30% increase to a Skill Affix. This means there are specific patterns to be aware of depending on when you crit with Masterworking. This system is inconsistent for items that start with a base of +4 ranks to a skill or higher. You can find out what Masterwork ranks these items have their Passive/Skill upgrades using our As shown in the table, you will not get more than one skill rank upgrading from rank 0 to rank 12 without a MW: Crit. This upgrade occurs at Rank 7 specifically. This means you can get cheap skill rank upgrades early in your progression by upgrading your gear to these specific breakpoints. Remember that a Greater Affix on a Passive does not necessarily imply that you will deal more damage when you have finished Masterworking. Based on the table above, you would go from rank 6 to 7 by hitting GA on a passive. Using the rogue passive , going from rank 9 to 10 would net you a damage increase while hitting GA on Dexterity % with 2272 dexterity would make you deal increased damage. These gains are small, but if you optimize your character, every bit matters! You can reset an item's Masterworking Ranks back to Rank 0. Players may want to reset an item's Masterworking Rank if the MW: Crit bonus received at Rank 4, 8, or 12 was applied to a less valuable affix. If getting a MW: Crit bonus on one particular Affix is vital, then a player may want to reset Masterwork Rank at Rank 4 if they didn't get the proc they wanted. Dedicated players may reset their item at Rank 8, which could be extremely costly. Resetting at Rank 12 is not recommended unless you are overflowing in materials, as resetting puts the item back at Rank 0."

To use a practical example, an affix with GA and upgraded to rank 6/12 with one MW: Crit would be increased by . Affixes with whole-number values are rounded down after their bonuses are applied. A single affix can receive the MW: Crit bonus multiple times. Affixes that receive this bonus once are , twice are , and three times are . At Rank 12, an item has a guaranteed total of 45% (5% times 9 upgrades between 1-3, 5-7, and 9-11). This means that a Rank 12 Affix would have the following total bonus, depending on how many times it received a MW: Crit: as our example, it has the following base stats: At Masterworking 12/12, we would expect these stats to increase in the following way: However, as we can see, the last part is not following the expected formula. The expected result would have been +4 ranks to Core Skills, but we ended up with +5. This is something called the \"30% rule\" in the community. This is covered in the section below. Masterworking has a specific pattern for increasing skill ranks based on MW: Crits and GA rolls on the item. The pattern may seem random, but it is consistent across all skills, whether the item is a amulet, skill ranks on gloves, or even items! You get a skill rank each time you reach a 30% increase to a Skill Affix. This means there are specific patterns to be aware of depending on when you crit with Masterworking. This system is inconsistent for items that start with a base of +4 ranks to a skill or higher. You can find out what Masterwork ranks these items have their Passive/Skill upgrades using our As shown in the table, you will not get more than one skill rank upgrading from rank 0 to rank 12 without a MW: Crit. This upgrade occurs at Rank 7 specifically. This means you can get cheap skill rank upgrades early in your progression by upgrading your gear to these specific breakpoints. Remember that a Greater Affix on a Passive does not necessarily imply that you will deal more damage when you have finished Masterworking. Based on the table above, you would go from rank 6 to 7 by hitting GA on a passive. Using the rogue passive , going from rank 9 to 10 would net you a damage increase while hitting GA on Dexterity % with 2272 dexterity would make you deal increased damage. These gains are small, but if you optimize your character, every bit matters! You can reset an item's Masterworking Ranks back to Rank 0. Players may want to reset an item's Masterworking Rank if the MW: Crit bonus received at Rank 4, 8, or 12 was applied to a less valuable affix. If getting a MW: Crit bonus on one particular Affix is vital, then a player may want to reset Masterwork Rank at Rank 4 if they didn't get the proc they wanted. Dedicated players may reset their item at Rank 8, which could be extremely costly. Resetting at Rank 12 is not recommended unless you are overflowing in materials, as resetting puts the item back at Rank 0."
