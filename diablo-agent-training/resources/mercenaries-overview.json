    "content": "of the new companion introduced in Vessel of Hatred, the new expansion for Diablo IV. These are ordinary people, with extraordinary skills. Like you, they aim to fight the enemies that are threatening Sanctuary. Unlocked throughout the Main Quest of Vessel of Hatred, these Pale Hand Mercenaries arrive just in time whenever you call for aid. While you start with Raheir, who is available after the Vessel of Hatred campaign, you unlock the others through key quests given through The Den, the Mercenary hideout. You never have to fight alone with your Mercenaries by your side! Initially, you meet Raheir, the Mercenary who introduces you to the Mercenary system. As you continue the Vessel of Hatred storyline, you acquire three Acquisition Campaigns for the other three Mercenaries. As you complete these additional key quests, you unlock the Mercenaries. However, you can only hire one Mercenary to join you at a time, solo or in a party (via the Party Leader) Once you have unlocked more than one Mercenary, you can be aided by two at a time. You can choose one Mercenary to be your Hired Mercenary and another for your Reinforcement Mercenary. The Hired choice is someone who fights alongside you constantly and has a fully fleshed-out skill tree with skills and passives they will use. This choice is often build-dependent as they provide impactful options through their passives. Make sure to read the Mercenary section of our to learn more about how Mercenaries affect our builds. The second acts as your Reinforcement Mercenary, which has an abbreviated skill tree and comes in tag-team style on command. Combining your skill with one of the Mercenary's own, the Mercenary is summoned to perform the selected skill with you. These Mercenaries will only use the base version of their skills and will not be affected by their passives. It does not cost Gold to hire Mercenaries. However, they can 'die' in battle - they take a knee and rest, and during this time, they cannot use skills. However, you can rush to them and 'revive' them just like you can a fellow player, which gets them back on their feet sooner! Over time in battle, you establish trust or 'Rapport' with your Mercenaries. This is most quickly done by fighting with them by your side. Rapport is what upgrades your Mercenary, allowing you to buy skill points to unlock more abilities, caches, and also increasing your ability to barter. Each tier unlocks the following things: Mercenaries do not only get Rapport while they are your Hired Mercenary, but even the Reinforcement gets Rapport. However, this Rapport is reduced by 50% while a Hired Mercenary is active. Mercenary-related events also appear throughout Sanctuary and offer bonus Rapport to be earned with your current companion. Each Mercenary has 10 levels of Rapport to accomplish, and once you reach the top, you can re-complete level 10 over and over again to earn Pale Marks to barter with. Earned through gathering Rapport, allows you to purchase items from Fayira in the Den through the bartering system. This vendor unlocks more available options when you reach Rapport Tier 5 and 8 for each Mercenary. Each Mercenary unlocks a specific Bartering option. You can restock the options Fayira offers for 100 . She also occasionally has powerful items with Greater Ancestral affixes available for trade. You unlock four Mercenaries during your time in Vessel of Hatred. Each Mercenary has their own unique set of skills and abilities. Similar to your own skill tree, there are passive and active skills.  These selections will change their behavior including how they attack.  Below is an example of what a Mercenary Skill Tree will look like as well as your Reinforcement. Trained by the Iron Wolves, Raheir uses his shield to block incoming attacks and protect you while wandering the wilds of Sanctuary. He also has a shield throw attack, among others. He is the defensive-style Mercenary, there to absorb the damage and take the attention off of you. Raheir has multiple survivability tools in his kit that allow your character to stay alive, such as . He also has the best defensive passives in the game in the form of For those interested in dealing more damage, has a high uptime from both and whenever is triggered. Raheir is an excellent choice if you need a little bit of extra resistance or armor to be ready for Torment IV. A disgraced archer who is now a bounty hunter for hire, Subo is your guy if you want someone who's out of melee range. He is more of a utility hero, and his mechanisms include things like marking enemies for disposal and once they're killed, you gain benefits such as Cooldown reduction. Subo has a plethora of passives that empower different build archetypes through various buffs: Subo also has the best overworld skill in the game in the form of . The passive part of this skill shows all enemies and materials in the area, effectively giving you a maphack. Half-child, half-demon, Aldkin is your caster. He can shapeshift into a demon to fight by your side, utilizing magic to support you. Aldkin is a special Mercenary because his kit has a \"kiss and curse\" mechanic. makes both you and nearby enemies vulnerable or makes you lose 8% Maximum Resource per second depending on the Curse type. His kit is mixed and allows for many different buffs depending on the build path. The Shadow path focuses on ground-based AoE buffs in which provides you with both Damage Reduction and Damage. Meanwhile, the Fire path puts the Damage buff on target instead through A former cannibal who left her clan when they started dealing with even darker arts, Varyana has a 'Massacre Meter' that measures your kill streak. The more enemies you kill in a row, the stronger she gets. She is your close-quarters combat and requires you to be in high-density areas to make the best use of her. Varyana's main passive makes her excellent for farming because it provides you with a stacking movement speed buff. She has access to two different Attack Speed buffs, . This depends on her actively hitting the target, which means she can randomly lose uptime on the buff. On top of this, she also has access to grouping from both . Grouping enemies is often a premium for many builds, so using Varyana can free up other skill slots in your build."
