Functionally, they act very similarly to Nightmare Dungeon Sigils, including the ability to teleport you to the starting point once you are ready. The Compasses scale to your current difficulty and randomly generate with either 6, 8, or 10 waves of combat. When you enter the Burning Hells to run the Infernal Hordes activity, you're faced with time-limited waves of enemies that last 60 seconds each.

Once you have completed each wave, you are faced with a choice between three Infernal Offers, each containing a boon and a bane.

All active effects of Offers can be viewed in your Map overlay. The Offers you choose have an apparent effect on the types and frequency of events that occur during waves. For example, Hellborne and Aether Lords won't spawn at all unless a corresponding Offer is selected.
