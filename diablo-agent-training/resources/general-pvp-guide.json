    "content": "The Fields of Hatred are endgame Player vs Player (PvP) zones where you can test your might in Diablo 4. It is a battlefield ridden with carnage, blood, death, and destruction where many meet their end. The goal is to kill monsters and players to collect Seeds of Hatred and then purify them for rewards. Let's learn everything about this game mode and how you can be the ruler of PvP! The Fields of Hatred combines PvP and PvE into a fun and chaotic battleground. You are constantly attacking monsters, bosses, and other players while trying to stay alive and collect experience, loot, and resources. If you are strong enough to fend everyone off, it can be quite lucrative to hold the PvP zone for as long as you can. Beware though: the more you kill, the higher the price that is placed on your death! Both Fields of Hatred locations are in the . Once you arrive you can turn on Mark for Blood to attack other players. You can choose to enter the zone peacefully and simply fight monsters, but any player who has marked themselves for blood can be attacked and attack you freely. You can remove the Mark for Blood at the Altar of Cleansing in town. Monsters, Events, and Chests in the Fields of Hatred drop Seeds of Hatred. They can be turned into Red Dust at the Altar of Extraction. Once a player starts a ritual at any of the altars, other players are notified and can try to kill the player who started the ritual. If a player is killed, collected Seeds of Hatred are dropped and can be picked up by other players. Once a player purifies Seeds of Hatred into Red Dust they are bound to the player and won't drop on death. Red Dust can be used to obtain Special Transmogs, new Mounts, and Weapons. Defeated players also drop on death that can kept as a trophy or be sold for 1 Gold... but we all know the trophies are priceless. As you kill other players, you infuse yourself with the Curse of Mephisto and start becoming a Vessel of Hatred. Once that happens, everyone within a very large radius of you (possibly the entire zone) is going  to see you as a threat on the map. If they kill you, they receive bonus rewards. Here your mission is simple - survive. If you're successful without running away or taking a town portal trying to escape, there are major rewards waiting for you! We never knew we'd BECOME the treasure goblin everyone is after :). You can buy consumables for that are only usable in the Fields of Hatred to aid you: You can also gamble for items through the Unsavory Oddities vendor. Similar to the , items are offered in exchange for the Purified found in the PVP area. However, the selection is far more limited."
