    "content": "The Gathering Legions zone event is a special event in Diablo 4. These prominently show up on the map with a timer, and you can participate simply by going there. Other players may be present and assist you, as this is a big event. These Zone Events have a much larger scale than and should not be confused with that you randomly come across as you travel through Sanctuary. In this guide, we cover how to find and complete the Gathering Legions event successfully. Each zone has a specific area where they will spawn. In , you will find this event at the top left region known as Kor Dragan. Before it starts, you are alerted on your world map when this event begins. When an event has started, the icon on your world map glows orange. It is possible to enter an event after it starts, but if the event disappears from the world map, that means it was completed. Objectives await as you arrive. There are 3 waves and a boss at the end. This works much like a time trial system, with each wave being progressively harder. In each wave, you defeat a bunch of monsters within a time limit. Once enough enemies have been killed, a stronger monster called a \"Servant of Hell\", which also has a time limit, spawns for players to slay. After completing the previous waves, you fight their Overlord in the final stage. Finishing the first wave and defeating the first Harbinger is enough to complete the Gathering Legions in the base version of the game. Failing the second wave spawns the overlord. Take down the overlord,, and the event is complete. The main incentive to also complete the second and third waves is to achieve the Mastery bonus that offers extra rewards, similar to Local Events.  New to Season 4, these Overlords are similar to Dungeon bosses, complete with huge health and stagger bars. Failing to finish the first wave results in failing the entire event and despawning all enemies with no rewards. To make the most progress possible, everyone present should split up to cover all areas where enemies are spawning. Completing the events rewards the participating players with gold, items, crafting materials, and The Gathering Legion event in Nahantu differs from its base game counterpart. This version is an escort mission where players must work together to ensure a massive orb reaches its final destination, called the Basin of Souls. You must stand near the orb for it to traverse along its predetermined path. As long as you do not run outside the red indication around the orb, it will eventually reach its destination. The first stop is at the halfway point! At this time, you must kill the tethered enemies before the orb will continue along its route. There are enemies to slay on each side of the orb, indicated by a red line connected to the enemies. Once the tethered enemies have been slain, the orb will continue moving. Once the orb reaches the end of its initial path, it will spawn more enemies that you must kill to fill the Soul Basin. Afterward, you must escort the orb back to its original starting point. Once this is done, two additional orbs will spawn, indicated by the icons on your minimap. You must escort both of them to the end and back to the beginning. Repeating the mechanics from the original orb. Make sure to complete the full Mastery reward of this event by escorting all five Soul Basins along their paths without them getting destroyed! Ultimately, this is an online multiplayer game where you run into other players doing the same thing as you. Zone Events are no different, as everyone can see these as they pop up. If by chance you reach the event and you're alone, it is still possible to complete these events, although much harder. In the base game, you only need to complete the first wave to spawn the overlord and collect the loot chest. This is entirely possible solo. However, completing Mastery is nearly impossible as the second and third waves require killing mobs fast enough around the entire area at the same time. Meanwhile, it is possible to complete the escort quest in Nahantu as a singular player. Escorting multiple Soul Basins may be difficult, if not impossible. If you find yourself attempting to complete it solo, you should try to finish the main escort to reap the rewards. Not found anywhere else in the game, world events bring a sense of togetherness in your journey through Sanctuary that works well as a distraction from other content. When you see one pop up on the map, swiftly head there and group up with other people! Maintained by"
