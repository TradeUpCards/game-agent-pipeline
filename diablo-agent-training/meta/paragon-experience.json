    "content": "This Paragon Experience Guide teaches you everything you need to know about Experience and how to reach Paragon level 300 as fast as possible. This guide focuses on how to optimize experience gained. Read our article for a more fundamental overview of this system. Experience is rewarded to the player with certain rules. The most efficient place to gain experience is , where experience scales based on the level you are clearing. Notably, the closing experience is considered a quest reward and is therefore not affected by experience multipliers such as Elixirs and Incenses. As shown in the graph, the experience gained from Pit closing EXP diverges from Enemy EXP. This indicates that the deeper you go into the Pit, the less significant monster EXP becomes. Consequently, it is more beneficial to focus on clearing each Pit level as quickly as possible, as most of the experience is awarded at the end. The formula for total EXP from the Pit is roughly equal to  (60000 x Pit Level + 1950000) + (170 x Pit Level + 7000) x 160. Since experience scales slowly per Pit level, the most significant factor for efficient farming is clear time. To illustrate this, we use the collective experience formula for a level 100 Pit clear completed in 1 minute and 30 seconds and determine when it equals the experience from a run cleared in 2 minutes. To gain the same experience when clearing 30 seconds slower, you have to do Pit level instead. Using the same formulas, we can determine that doing a 55 in 1 minute and 30 seconds is the same experience per minute as doing an 85 in 2 minutes. If you gain 7860000 EXP per minute like the example above, it would take you 52.54 hours to go from Paragon level 1 to 300, or 2101 Pit clears. If you were to do the same Pit tier, but in 2 minutes instead, it would take you 70 hours to reach paragon 300 in the same amount of Pit clears. You want to do Pit levels where movement is your only cap, not the damage you deal. The Pit is far more efficient than any other content in the game for Experience, but how much more efficient is it? Let us find out. As we can see in this graph, the Pit is the most efficient place to farm experience if time is the only factor. Even when the content is equally difficult, the Pit is 33% more efficient than Infernal Horde. This gap only increases further the higher Pit levels you can clear. It is worth noting that the gap is reduced slightly during events such as Mother's Blessing (35% Multiplicative Experience buff), as 100% of the experience from Infernal Hordes comes from monster kills. The grind to Paragon 300 is long, and it may feel like you have made significant progress when you get into the upper 200 levels. However, Experience is an exponential function, so you are further away from the goal than you think. When you reach Paragon level 240, you have only gained 9.13% of the total experience required to hit level 300. At Paragon level 280, you have collected 43.44% of the total experience requirement. This farm is intended to be aspirational and thus something only the most dedicated players will achieve. Farming experience efficiently boils down to one thing and one thing only: farming the Pit as fast as possible. Reviewed by"
