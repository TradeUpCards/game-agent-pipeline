This guide covers currently existing maps, mob type combinations, and strategies to complete the highest levels of the Pit. This guide assumes you have a basic knowledge of the Pit and the system, and you can find this basic information in our Pit Pushing is not for the faint of heart. Due to the wide variety of available builds, it is impossible to list everything required for each one to function effectively in a Pit Pushing environment. For information on specific builds, head over to our and look for our Pit Pushing variants. However, there are some generic preparations you can do to optimize your character. Most builds also require certain mob types, specific maps, or even bosses to complete at the highest level. Because of this, you must farm a lot of Artificer Stones. You can find which activities provide the most Artificer Stones in our Optimal Farming Guide. Not all builds are viable for Pit Pushing at the highest level. To compete with the best of the best, you must use the best builds available. The Pit has 10 different Monster Family combinations and 11 different bosses. This creates over 990 combinations of enemies that you face in the Pit. This section of the guide focuses on specific enemies, highlighting which ones are good for pushing and which should be avoided. The following Monster Family combinations were observed, and importantly, it was observed that Monster Family combinations could not occur twice in a row. This means that every pair of Monster Families has 9 different pairings and cannot be repeated. Enemies marked in are preferred, are passable but not ideal, and means they should be avoided. Based on the experience of our Pit Pushers, the clear winner in terms of efficient enemies for pushing is the combined with . The reason why other Monster Families are less efficient is because of their inherited abilities. teleport or charge a lot, causing them to get scattered. deals massive damage and pushes you back. are durable thanks to their barriers and also deal massive damage. Currently, 11 bosses are available in the Pit, each with a 9.09% uniform spawn rate. Ideal bosses are build-dependent, but some outliers are universally optimal for most builds. The table below shows all available bosses ranked in order of efficiency. Bosses with adds generally have fewer health points than bosses without adds, making them more efficient to kill. This causes the unfortunate side effect that most builds favour bosses with adds, as the builds utilized for Pit Pushing already have Area of Effect damage in their kits. In the Pit, bosses have a special mechanic referred to as Echoes. Echoes are abilities from old boss fights that deal a large amount of damage to the player. They start with a Tier 1 Echo, then gain a Tier 2 Echo when their health drops to 75%, and a Tier 3 Echo at 50%. Most of them have a uniform distribution, except for the Tier 2 Echo which only occurs after either Elias' or the Succubus' The Echoes below are coloured based on how much time you lose having these in your run. means it is safe and easy to play around. implies that they require more movement and awareness, while signifies how deadly the Echo is for most builds. The only truly dangerous echoes among these are Mother's Embrace and Demonic Slam, both of which can be deadly for less durable builds. Maps in the Pit are randomly generated based on 18 different environments and additional parameters. This section of the guide explains the system in depth so that the probability of finding your ideal maps can be more easily understood. The table below is the TLDR of the information gathered from 250 maps worth of testing. The Pit has two types of maps, linear and open. Open layouts offer more options for the player to do larger pulls and have minimal backtracking, while narrow, linear maps can sometimes force players to double back and do smaller pulls, leading to wasted time. The table below lists all available maps in order of efficiency. The Pit has 18 distinctly different maps shared by two separate pools of maps. Pool 1 has 8 of these maps, while Pool 2 has 15. Since 15 plus 8 does not equal 18, this implies that some maps are shared between the two pools. See the infographic below to see the map pools. In 250 recorded Pit runs, the first map did not share the environment type with the second map a single time. The expected probability of getting a repeated map is , meaning we should have expected to see it 17 times in 250 attempts, making the outcome unlikely. Using Map Pool 1 as an example, if your first map is Bloodsoaked Crag, you end that pit run with Bloodsoaked Crag as your second map. This means that Grasslands can only pair up with the other 7 maps in the Pool, which you can see in the list below. This means that Pool 1 has map combinations. On the other hand, Map Pool 2 has 15 unique maps, with 1 map that can be both the starting and the ending map. This means we have 7 starting options with 8 end maps, and 1 starting option with 7 end maps. That gives us combinations in Map Pool 2. In total, this gives us different map combinations in the Pit. Bloodsoaked Crag (Grasslands) Hallowed Ossuary (Catacombs) Raethwind Wilds Crusader's Cathedral Lost Archives Buried Halls (Cultists) Guulrahn Slum (Fallen City) Shivta Ruins Immortal Emanation Ularian Sepulcher (Temple #1) Putrescent Larder (Temple #2) Farai Cliffs (Desert) Hoarfrost Demise Vile Hive (Plague Tunnels) Kor Dragan Barracks Demon's Wake (Cellar) Abandoned Mineworks Sleepless Hollow (Desert Tunnel) The accordions below have screenshots of each environment and layout examples associated with that map. It is important to note that these maps are randomly generated, meaning the layout shown is just one of a few possible configurations. This section dives deep into strategies used by Pit Pushers to save valuable seconds when clearing the Pit at the highest level. There are strategies utilized by most builds, while some depend entirely on the strengths and weaknesses of the build you are playing. Some strategies focus on efficiently killing enemies to fill the Pit progression bar, while others involve proper boss positioning to maximize damage uptime. Importantly, not all builds use each of these strategies, and it is up to the Pit Pusher to find out what is most optimal for their setup and playstyle. These strategies are ways to optimize combat efficiency and save time, and must be used strategically. Fishing for the most favourable combinations of maps, enemies, and bosses is nothing new for the diehard fans of the Pit. Fishing means you begin a Pit run to see which environment and enemy type you get, and if it is not ideal, you teleport out and try again. All the Monster Family combinations appear to be converging towards a 10% observed rate, meaning that the chances of each combination appearing are likely uniformly set to 10%. Knowing this, we can calculate the probability of certain Monster Families appearing. For instance, our preferred pairing appearing on either the first map, the second, or both, has a probability of occurring . However, if you them on both Maps for pushing, this only has a chance of occurring Including the 9.09% probability for bosses, if there are 3 ideal bosses for your build, you now have a probability to get the optimal enemy combination each time you open the Pit. We could also include the odds of avoiding the two more difficult echoes, removing 50% of the possible boss fights. We would then be down to probability of a favourable outcome. The following table shows the probability of getting the specific maps based on the patterns observed from the data. Remember to check if the map pairing you desire is possible. If you only want Farai Cliffs, Ularian Sepulcher, and Putrescent Larder for pushing, you have a chance of getting an ideal First Map. Remember that not all of the First Maps lead to all Second Maps, which makes calculating the full probability a little bit difficult. The maps mentioned in this example are all in Pool 2, making it easier to calculate and visualize. Using Raethwind Wilds as our Second Map, the total probability would be: Using the examples above, we would have a chance of getting the right enemy combination and a chance of getting the correct maps. This combined is a chance of occurring whenever you open a Pit map. The probability calculated in this example is for a specific scenario in mind, and depending on the build, you could have more favourable outcomes.

This means that every pair of Monster Families has 9 different pairings and cannot be repeated. Enemies marked in are preferred, are passable but not ideal, and means they should be avoided. Based on the experience of our Pit Pushers, the clear winner in terms of efficient enemies for pushing is the combined with . The reason why other Monster Families are less efficient is because of their inherited abilities. teleport or charge a lot, causing them to get scattered. deals massive damage and pushes you back. are durable thanks to their barriers and also deal massive damage. Currently, 11 bosses are available in the Pit, each with a 9.09% uniform spawn rate. Ideal bosses are build-dependent, but some outliers are universally optimal for most builds. The table below shows all available bosses ranked in order of efficiency. Bosses with adds generally have fewer health points than bosses without adds, making them more efficient to kill. This causes the unfortunate side effect that most builds favour bosses with adds, as the builds utilized for Pit Pushing already have Area of Effect damage in their kits. In the Pit, bosses have a special mechanic referred to as Echoes. Echoes are abilities from old boss fights that deal a large amount of damage to the player. They start with a Tier 1 Echo, then gain a Tier 2 Echo when their health drops to 75%, and a Tier 3 Echo at 50%. Most of them have a uniform distribution, except for the Tier 2 Echo which only occurs after either Elias' or the Succubus' The Echoes below are coloured based on how much time you lose having these in your run. means it is safe and easy to play around. implies that they require more movement and awareness, while signifies how deadly the Echo is for most builds. The only truly dangerous echoes among these are Mother's Embrace and Demonic Slam, both of which can be deadly for less durable builds. Maps in the Pit are randomly generated based on 18 different environments and additional parameters. This section of the guide explains the system in depth so that the probability of finding your ideal maps can be more easily understood. The table below is the TLDR of the information gathered from 250 maps worth of testing. The Pit has two types of maps, linear and open. Open layouts offer more options for the player to do larger pulls and have minimal backtracking, while narrow, linear maps can sometimes force players to double back and do smaller pulls, leading to wasted time. The table below lists all available maps in order of efficiency. The Pit has 18 distinctly different maps shared by two separate pools of maps. Pool 1 has 8 of these maps, while Pool 2 has 15. Since 15 plus 8 does not equal 18, this implies that some maps are shared between the two pools. See the infographic below to see the map pools. In 250 recorded Pit runs, the first map did not share the environment type with the second map a single time. The expected probability of getting a repeated map is , meaning we should have expected to see it 17 times in 250 attempts, making the outcome unlikely. Using Map Pool 1 as an example, if your first map is Bloodsoaked Crag, you end that pit run with Bloodsoaked Crag as your second map. This means that Grasslands can only pair up with the other 7 maps in the Pool, which you can see in the list below. This means that Pool 1 has map combinations. On the other hand, Map Pool 2 has 15 unique maps, with 1 map that can be both the starting and the ending map. This means we have 7 starting options with 8 end maps, and 1 starting option with 7 end maps. That gives us combinations in Map Pool 2. In total, this gives us different map combinations in the Pit. Bloodsoaked Crag (Grasslands) Hallowed Ossuary (Catacombs) Raethwind Wilds Crusader's Cathedral Lost Archives Buried Halls (Cultists) Guulrahn Slum (Fallen City) Shivta Ruins Immortal Emanation Ularian Sepulcher (Temple #1) Putrescent Larder (Temple #2) Farai Cliffs (Desert) Hoarfrost Demise Vile Hive (Plague Tunnels) Kor Dragan Barracks Demon's Wake (Cellar) Abandoned Mineworks Sleepless Hollow (Desert Tunnel) The accordions below have screenshots of each environment and layout examples associated with that map. It is important to note that these maps are randomly generated, meaning the layout shown is just one of a few possible configurations. This section dives deep into strategies used by Pit Pushers to save valuable seconds when clearing the Pit at the highest level. There are strategies utilized by most builds, while some depend entirely on the strengths and weaknesses of the build you are playing. Some strategies focus on efficiently killing enemies to fill the Pit progression bar, while others involve proper boss positioning to maximize damage uptime. Importantly, not all builds use each of these strategies, and it is up to the Pit Pusher to find out what is most optimal for their setup and playstyle. These strategies are ways to optimize combat efficiency and save time, and must be used strategically. Fishing for the most favourable combinations of maps, enemies, and bosses is nothing new for the diehard fans of the Pit. Fishing means you begin a Pit run to see which environment and enemy type you get, and if it is not ideal, you teleport out and try again. All the Monster Family combinations appear to be converging towards a 10% observed rate, meaning that the chances of each combination appearing are likely uniformly set to 10%. Knowing this, we can calculate the probability of certain Monster Families appearing. For instance, our preferred pairing appearing on either the first map, the second, or both, has a probability of occurring . However, if you them on both Maps for pushing, this only has a chance of occurring Including the 9.09% probability for bosses, if there are 3 ideal bosses for your build, you now have a probability to get the optimal enemy combination each time you open the Pit. We could also include the odds of avoiding the two more difficult echoes, removing 50% of the possible boss fights. We would then be down to probability of a favourable outcome. The following table shows the probability of getting the specific maps based on the patterns observed from the data. Remember to check if the map pairing you desire is possible. If you only want Farai Cliffs, Ularian Sepulcher, and Putrescent Larder for pushing, you have a chance of getting an ideal First Map. Remember that not all of the First Maps lead to all Second Maps, which makes calculating the full probability a little bit difficult. The maps mentioned in this example are all in Pool 2, making it easier to calculate and visualize. Using Raethwind Wilds as our Second Map, the total probability would be: Using the examples above, we would have a chance of getting the right enemy combination and a chance of getting the correct maps. This combined is a chance of occurring whenever you open a Pit map. The probability calculated in this example is for a specific scenario in mind, and depending on the build, you could have more favourable outcomes.

Maps in the Pit are randomly generated based on 18 different environments and additional parameters. This section of the guide explains the system in depth so that the probability of finding your ideal maps can be more easily understood. The table below is the TLDR of the information gathered from 250 maps worth of testing. The Pit has two types of maps, linear and open. Open layouts offer more options for the player to do larger pulls and have minimal backtracking, while narrow, linear maps can sometimes force players to double back and do smaller pulls, leading to wasted time. The table below lists all available maps in order of efficiency. The Pit has 18 distinctly different maps shared by two separate pools of maps. Pool 1 has 8 of these maps, while Pool 2 has 15. Since 15 plus 8 does not equal 18, this implies that some maps are shared between the two pools. See the infographic below to see the map pools. In 250 recorded Pit runs, the first map did not share the environment type with the second map a single time. The expected probability of getting a repeated map is , meaning we should have expected to see it 17 times in 250 attempts, making the outcome unlikely. Using Map Pool 1 as an example, if your first map is Bloodsoaked Crag, you end that pit run with Bloodsoaked Crag as your second map. This means that Grasslands can only pair up with the other 7 maps in the Pool, which you can see in the list below. This means that Pool 1 has map combinations. On the other hand, Map Pool 2 has 15 unique maps, with 1 map that can be both the starting and the ending map. This means we have 7 starting options with 8 end maps, and 1 starting option with 7 end maps. That gives us combinations in Map Pool 2. In total, this gives us different map combinations in the Pit.

It is important to note that these maps are randomly generated, meaning the layout shown is just one of a few possible configurations. This section dives deep into strategies used by Pit Pushers to save valuable seconds when clearing the Pit at the highest level. There are strategies utilized by most builds, while some depend entirely on the strengths and weaknesses of the build you are playing. Some strategies focus on efficiently killing enemies to fill the Pit progression bar, while others involve proper boss positioning to maximize damage uptime. Importantly, not all builds use each of these strategies, and it is up to the Pit Pusher to find out what is most optimal for their setup and playstyle. These strategies are ways to optimize combat efficiency and save time, and must be used strategically. Fishing for the most favourable combinations of maps, enemies, and bosses is nothing new for the diehard fans of the Pit. Fishing means you begin a Pit run to see which environment and enemy type you get, and if it is not ideal, you teleport out and try again. All the Monster Family combinations appear to be converging towards a 10% observed rate, meaning that the chances of each combination appearing are likely uniformly set to 10%.

Most of them have a uniform distribution, except for the Tier 2 Echo which only occurs after either Elias' or the Succubus' The Echoes below are coloured based on how much time you lose having these in your run. means it is safe and easy to play around. implies that they require more movement and awareness, while signifies how deadly the Echo is for most builds. The only truly dangerous echoes among these are Mother's Embrace and Demonic Slam, both of which can be deadly for less durable builds. Maps in the Pit are randomly generated based on 18 different environments and additional parameters. This section of the guide explains the system in depth so that the probability of finding your ideal maps can be more easily understood. The table below is the TLDR of the information gathered from 250 maps worth of testing. The Pit has two types of maps, linear and open. Open layouts offer more options for the player to do larger pulls and have minimal backtracking, while narrow, linear maps can sometimes force players to double back and do smaller pulls, leading to wasted time. The table below lists all available maps in order of efficiency. The Pit has 18 distinctly different maps shared by two separate pools of maps. Pool 1 has 8 of these maps, while Pool 2 has 15. Since 15 plus 8 does not equal 18, this implies that some maps are shared between the two pools. See the infographic below to see the map pools. In 250 recorded Pit runs, the first map did not share the environment type with the second map a single time. The expected probability of getting a repeated map is , meaning we should have expected to see it 17 times in 250 attempts, making the outcome unlikely. Using Map Pool 1 as an example, if your first map is Bloodsoaked Crag, you end that pit run with Bloodsoaked Crag as your second map. This means that Grasslands can only pair up with the other 7 maps in the Pool, which you can see in the list below. This means that Pool 1 has map combinations. On the other hand, Map Pool 2 has 15 unique maps, with 1 map that can be both the starting and the ending map. This means we have 7 starting options with 8 end maps, and 1 starting option with 7 end maps. That gives us combinations in Map Pool 2. In total, this gives us different map combinations in the Pit. Bloodsoaked Crag (Grasslands) Hallowed Ossuary (Catacombs) Raethwind Wilds Crusader's Cathedral Lost Archives Buried Halls (Cultists) Guulrahn Slum (Fallen City) Shivta Ruins Immortal Emanation Ularian Sepulcher (Temple #1) Putrescent Larder (Temple #2) Farai Cliffs (Desert) Hoarfrost Demise Vile Hive (Plague Tunnels) Kor Dragan Barracks Demon's Wake (Cellar) Abandoned Mineworks Sleepless Hollow (Desert Tunnel) The accordions below have screenshots of each environment and layout examples associated with that map. It is important to note that these maps are randomly generated, meaning the layout shown is just one of a few possible configurations. This section dives deep into strategies used by Pit Pushers to save valuable seconds when clearing the Pit at the highest level. There are strategies utilized by most builds, while some depend entirely on the strengths and weaknesses of the build you are playing. Some strategies focus on efficiently killing enemies to fill the Pit progression bar, while others involve proper boss positioning to maximize damage uptime. Importantly, not all builds use each of these strategies, and it is up to the Pit Pusher to find out what is most optimal for their setup and playstyle. These strategies are ways to optimize combat efficiency and save time, and must be used strategically. Fishing for the most favourable combinations of maps, enemies, and bosses is nothing new for the diehard fans of the Pit. Fishing means you begin a Pit run to see which environment and enemy type you get, and if it is not ideal, you teleport out and try again. All the Monster Family combinations appear to be converging towards a 10% observed rate, meaning that the chances of each combination appearing are likely uniformly set to 10%. Knowing this, we can calculate the probability of certain Monster Families appearing. For instance, our preferred pairing appearing on either the first map, the second, or both, has a probability of occurring . However, if you them on both Maps for pushing, this only has a chance of occurring Including the 9.09% probability for bosses, if there are 3 ideal bosses for your build, you now have a probability to get the optimal enemy combination each time you open the Pit. We could also include the odds of avoiding the two more difficult echoes, removing 50% of the possible boss fights. We would then be down to probability of a favourable outcome. The following table shows the probability of getting the specific maps based on the patterns observed from the data. Remember to check if the map pairing you desire is possible. If you only want Farai Cliffs, Ularian Sepulcher, and Putrescent Larder for pushing, you have a chance of getting an ideal First Map. Remember that not all of the First Maps lead to all Second Maps, which makes calculating the full probability a little bit difficult. The maps mentioned in this example are all in Pool 2, making it easier to calculate and visualize. Using Raethwind Wilds as our Second Map, the total probability would be: Using the examples above, we would have a chance of getting the right enemy combination and a chance of getting the correct maps. This combined is a chance of occurring whenever you open a Pit map. The probability calculated in this example is for a specific scenario in mind, and depending on the build, you could have more favourable outcomes.

Since 15 plus 8 does not equal 18, this implies that some maps are shared between the two pools. See the infographic below to see the map pools. In 250 recorded Pit runs, the first map did not share the environment type with the second map a single time. The expected probability of getting a repeated map is , meaning we should have expected to see it 17 times in 250 attempts, making the outcome unlikely. Using Map Pool 1 as an example, if your first map is Bloodsoaked Crag, you end that pit run with Bloodsoaked Crag as your second map. This means that Grasslands can only pair up with the other 7 maps in the Pool, which you can see in the list below. This means that Pool 1 has map combinations. On the other hand, Map Pool 2 has 15 unique maps, with 1 map that can be both the starting and the ending map. This means we have 7 starting options with 8 end maps, and 1 starting option with 7 end maps. That gives us combinations in Map Pool 2. In total, this gives us different map combinations in the Pit.

It is important to note that these maps are randomly generated, meaning the layout shown is just one of a few possible configurations. This section dives deep into strategies used by Pit Pushers to save valuable seconds when clearing the Pit at the highest level. There are strategies utilized by most builds, while some depend entirely on the strengths and weaknesses of the build you are playing. Some strategies focus on efficiently killing enemies to fill the Pit progression bar, while others involve proper boss positioning to maximize damage uptime. Importantly, not all builds use each of these strategies, and it is up to the Pit Pusher to find out what is most optimal for their setup and playstyle. These strategies are ways to optimize combat efficiency and save time, and must be used strategically. Fishing for the most favourable combinations of maps, enemies, and bosses is nothing new for the diehard fans of the Pit. Fishing means you begin a Pit run to see which environment and enemy type you get, and if it is not ideal, you teleport out and try again. All the Monster Family combinations appear to be converging towards a 10% observed rate, meaning that the chances of each combination appearing are likely uniformly set to 10%. Knowing this, we can calculate the probability of certain Monster Families appearing. For instance, our preferred pairing appearing on either the first map, the second, or both, has a probability of occurring . However, if you them on both Maps for pushing, this only has a chance of occurring Including the 9.09% probability for bosses, if there are 3 ideal bosses for your build, you now have a probability to get the optimal enemy combination each time you open the Pit. We could also include the odds of avoiding the two more difficult echoes, removing 50% of the possible boss fights. We would then be down to probability of a favourable outcome. The following table shows the probability of getting the specific maps based on the patterns observed from the data. Remember to check if the map pairing you desire is possible. If you only want Farai Cliffs, Ularian Sepulcher, and Putrescent Larder for pushing, you have a chance of getting an ideal First Map. Remember that not all of the First Maps lead to all Second Maps, which makes calculating the full probability a little bit difficult. The maps mentioned in this example are all in Pool 2, making it easier to calculate and visualize. Using Raethwind Wilds as our Second Map, the total probability would be: Using the examples above, we would have a chance of getting the right enemy combination and a chance of getting the correct maps. This combined is a chance of occurring whenever you open a Pit map. The probability calculated in this example is for a specific scenario in mind, and depending on the build, you could have more favourable outcomes.

There are strategies utilized by most builds, while some depend entirely on the strengths and weaknesses of the build you are playing. Some strategies focus on efficiently killing enemies to fill the Pit progression bar, while others involve proper boss positioning to maximize damage uptime. Importantly, not all builds use each of these strategies, and it is up to the Pit Pusher to find out what is most optimal for their setup and playstyle. These strategies are ways to optimize combat efficiency and save time, and must be used strategically. Fishing for the most favourable combinations of maps, enemies, and bosses is nothing new for the diehard fans of the Pit. Fishing means you begin a Pit run to see which environment and enemy type you get, and if it is not ideal, you teleport out and try again. All the Monster Family combinations appear to be converging towards a 10% observed rate, meaning that the chances of each combination appearing are likely uniformly set to 10%. Knowing this, we can calculate the probability of certain Monster Families appearing. For instance, our preferred pairing appearing on either the first map, the second, or both, has a probability of occurring . However, if you them on both Maps for pushing, this only has a chance of occurring Including the 9.09% probability for bosses, if there are 3 ideal bosses for your build, you now have a probability to get the optimal enemy combination each time you open the Pit. We could also include the odds of avoiding the two more difficult echoes, removing 50% of the possible boss fights. We would then be down to probability of a favourable outcome. The following table shows the probability of getting the specific maps based on the patterns observed from the data. Remember to check if the map pairing you desire is possible. If you only want Farai Cliffs, Ularian Sepulcher, and Putrescent Larder for pushing, you have a chance of getting an ideal First Map. Remember that not all of the First Maps lead to all Second Maps, which makes calculating the full probability a little bit difficult. The maps mentioned in this example are all in Pool 2, making it easier to calculate and visualize. Using Raethwind Wilds as our Second Map, the total probability would be: Using the examples above, we would have a chance of getting the right enemy combination and a chance of getting the correct maps. This combined is a chance of occurring whenever you open a Pit map. The probability calculated in this example is for a specific scenario in mind, and depending on the build, you could have more favourable outcomes.

It is important to note that these maps are randomly generated, meaning the layout shown is just one of a few possible configurations. This section dives deep into strategies used by Pit Pushers to save valuable seconds when clearing the Pit at the highest level. There are strategies utilized by most builds, while some depend entirely on the strengths and weaknesses of the build you are playing. Some strategies focus on efficiently killing enemies to fill the Pit progression bar, while others involve proper boss positioning to maximize damage uptime. Importantly, not all builds use each of these strategies, and it is up to the Pit Pusher to find out what is most optimal for their setup and playstyle. These strategies are ways to optimize combat efficiency and save time, and must be used strategically. Fishing for the most favourable combinations of maps, enemies, and bosses is nothing new for the diehard fans of the Pit. Fishing means you begin a Pit run to see which environment and enemy type you get, and if it is not ideal, you teleport out and try again. All the Monster Family combinations appear to be converging towards a 10% observed rate, meaning that the chances of each combination appearing are likely uniformly set to 10%. Knowing this, we can calculate the probability of certain Monster Families appearing. For instance, our preferred pairing appearing on either the first map, the second, or both, has a probability of occurring . However, if you them on both Maps for pushing, this only has a chance of occurring Including the 9.09% probability for bosses, if there are 3 ideal bosses for your build, you now have a probability to get the optimal enemy combination each time you open the Pit. We could also include the odds of avoiding the two more difficult echoes, removing 50% of the possible boss fights. We would then be down to probability of a favourable outcome. The following table shows the probability of getting the specific maps based on the patterns observed from the data. Remember to check if the map pairing you desire is possible. If you only want Farai Cliffs, Ularian Sepulcher, and Putrescent Larder for pushing, you have a chance of getting an ideal First Map. Remember that not all of the First Maps lead to all Second Maps, which makes calculating the full probability a little bit difficult. The maps mentioned in this example are all in Pool 2, making it easier to calculate and visualize. Using Raethwind Wilds as our Second Map, the total probability would be: Using the examples above, we would have a chance of getting the right enemy combination and a chance of getting the correct maps. This combined is a chance of occurring whenever you open a Pit map. The probability calculated in this example is for a specific scenario in mind, and depending on the build, you could have more favourable outcomes.
