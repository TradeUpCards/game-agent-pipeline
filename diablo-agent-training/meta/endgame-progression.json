With all the systems in place to help you progress your character towards Godmode power, guidance navigating through the endgame makes the process more efficient and less confusing. This Endgame Progression Guide assumes you are somewhat familiar with the various endgame activities and systems, but make sure to read the linked articles if you are uncertain. Let's get into it! The Guide uses Pit tiers as a measuring stick to determine when your character is strong enough to progress to the next step of the guide. This is by design, as the Guide should be usable for anyone playing any build, but you may need to do steps earlier to progress through the endgame. As a reminder, the Pit tiers translate to the following difficulties: Outliers do exist that allow you to skip a lot of the progression that other builds do not have to deal with. This article is a guideline on how a blaster progresses through the Torment levels as quickly as possible. The following list is what we refer to in this guide as General Farming Activities. These are activities especially effective for enhancing specific parts of your character. Once you hit level 60, you should aim to finish challenges to gain access to easy gear and Boss Lair Keys. Based on previous seasons, you can often finish up to Chapter 4 by this point in your progression. Once you have done this, head to in Cerrigar and progress to at least Pit level 10 to unlock Torment 1. Make sure to follow our and select the corresponding variant to begin your journey. This section starts when you have entered Torment 1, meaning you can clear level 10. Getting into Torment 1 unlocks plenty of options, and the following order is an efficient way to progress quickly through the Torment levels. Keep in mind that Armor and Resistance penalties grow harsher as you climb the Torment difficulty tiers. If you are feeling too squishy, boost your defenses with , Elixirs, and Incenses. This part of your Endgame Progression begins when you have entered Torment 3 at a minimum, meaning you can clear level 40+. Getting into Torment 3+ unlocks more efficient material farming, more loot from the Boss Lairs, and a higher chance of Ancestral items. It is not always the most efficient thing to brute force your way through Torment 4 when you are not ready yet. Farming the General Activities listed above in Torment 3 is far more efficient than struggling to complete those in Torment 4. Only swap to Torment 4 once you can do level 55+ efficiently. Climbing the Torment levels comes with a resistance and armor penalty. Make sure your character is durable enough to survive the highest Torment levels. The final part of your Endgame Progression begins when you can efficiently farm level 55+. Getting into Torment 4 unlocks even more efficient material farming, loot from the Boss Lair, and an even higher chance of Ancestral items. Maintained by Reviewed by"
