    "content": "In Diablo 4, your character has many stats -- some of them help you survive, while others help you kill enemies faster. There are also several utility stats that can reduce resource costs, reduce cooldowns of your skills, and more. In this article, we dive into the specifics of many different stats, what they do, and how to obtain them. There are four Core Stats in the game: Strength, Intelligence, Willpower, and Dexterity. You get different starting stats based on your class: Every time you level up, you gain +1 to every Core Stat. In addition, you can get individual Core Stat rolls on your Armor pieces and +All Stats rolls on Jewelry. Finally, you can get +2 to one of the Core Stats from certain Core Stats always give the following bonuses: There are also three more bonuses you get from Core stats, but which bonus comes from which stat changes, depending on your class: Offensive stats mostly come from your Weapons, Gloves, and Jewelry. These slots can be empowered with more offensive stats through the . They include, but are not limited to: All these stats serve to increase the damage you deal with your skills. Check out our post to learn more about them. Defensive Stats come from your armor pieces and help you stay alive. These include, but are not limited to: To learn more about these stats and how they work, refer to our Utility stats don't directly contribute to your damage or your defenses. However, they can greatly contribute to a build's power indirectly. These include, but are not limited to: In Diablo 4, there are a bunch of random on-hit effects you can trigger with any attack, which are called Lucky Hits. Lucky Hits come from many different sources: skills, passives, items, and . One example is a stat that can be found on weapons that reads: In addition to the chance mentioned in the effect itself, every has a base Lucky Hit Chance, which is something we usually call a proc coefficient in other games. This base Lucky Hit chance is multiplied by the chance listed in the Lucky Hit effect. : To view the base Lucky Hit Chance on Skills, you need to turn on Advanced Tooltips in Settings. Finally, we have a +% Lucky Hit Chance stat that can roll on Rings and Gloves. All these rolls are added together and act as another multiplier to your Lucky Hit Chance. Let's say you have the following stats on your items: And let's say you're hitting an Injured (less than 35% HP) enemy with the skill, which has a 50% Lucky Hit chance. In that case, your actual chance to execute this enemy is: There are 3 types of Lucky Hit stats that add a new Lucky Hit functionality to your character. Weapons can roll Chance to Heal, or Chance to Restore Primary Resource. Jewelry can roll Chance to Heal, or Chance to Make Enemies Vulnerable. Gloves can roll all three of these! An important note is that for the Heal and Restore Resource Lucky Hit effects, the chance is fixed at 5%, and instead, you stack the amount of Health or Resource regained on each proc. However, for Chance to make Enemies Vulnerable, you instead stack the chance it will occur, but with a set duration of 2 seconds. This stat reduces cooldowns of your active skills, as well as Charge Cooldowns of skills with charges. You can get Cooldown Reduction on your Helmet, Amulet, and Focus/Totem/Shield. Cooldown Reduction from different sources stacks inversely multiplicative and not additively. Example: if you have 10% Cooldown Reduction on your Amulet, and 8% on your helmet, you would have the following cooldown reduction. All classes can get a class-specific version of this stat through tempering. These tempered stats can only be applied to your jewelry and only work for that particular skill. Cooldown Reduction is capped at 75% regardless of the source of the Cooldown Reduction. This stat can roll on Jewelry, Gloves, and Weapons. They can also be obtained through tempering your Jewelry. As the name suggests, it reduces the cost of your skills. Unlike Cooldown Reduction, Resource Cost Reduction stacks multiplicatively with each source. Nearly every item can give you extra ranks in a certain Skill or even in an entire skill category, such as (Sorcerer Only) or (Rogue Only). These ranks work the same way as the ones you put in your , usually increasing the skill's damage by 10% of its rank 1 value or decreasing its Cooldown. This stat gives a flat bonus to your Maximum Resource. It can roll on Amulets and Helmets. This stat increases the amount of Resources you get from any source, including passive regeneration, your Basic Skills, and different passive or Legendary Aspects. It can be applied to Jewelry through the tempering system. Resource Generation stacks multiplicatively with itself and with On your Boots and Amulet, you can get a +% Movement Speed affix. As expected, it makes you run faster. Your total Movement Speed can not exceed 200%. You can also get this effect from tempering and specific unique items in the game. On high-level legendary Boots, you can find some special stats listed separately from all the others. You can get one of three effects on each item: This stat can now only be obtained through and tempering. It increases the duration of all Crowd Control effects you apply to enemies. These effects include Slow, Chill, Daze, Stun, Freeze, Immobilize, Taunt, and Knock Down. This stat is found through tempering and it reduces the duration of Crowd Control effects that enemies apply to you. Thorns is a special \"offensive\" stat that lets you deal damage to enemies when they hit you. Damage dealt is increased by your primary Core Stat. Thorns can roll on Helmets, Chests, Pants, and Shields, and you can also boost your Thorns with certain skills and passives. In Diablo 4, there are a lot of stats you can get from items, passives, and even skills. These stats improve your character in different ways, and stacking the correct stats is pivotal for your success in the game."

In that case, your actual chance to execute this enemy is: There are 3 types of Lucky Hit stats that add a new Lucky Hit functionality to your character. Weapons can roll Chance to Heal, or Chance to Restore Primary Resource. Jewelry can roll Chance to Heal, or Chance to Make Enemies Vulnerable. Gloves can roll all three of these! An important note is that for the Heal and Restore Resource Lucky Hit effects, the chance is fixed at 5%, and instead, you stack the amount of Health or Resource regained on each proc. However, for Chance to make Enemies Vulnerable, you instead stack the chance it will occur, but with a set duration of 2 seconds. This stat reduces cooldowns of your active skills, as well as Charge Cooldowns of skills with charges. You can get Cooldown Reduction on your Helmet, Amulet, and Focus/Totem/Shield. Cooldown Reduction from different sources stacks inversely multiplicative and not additively. Example: if you have 10% Cooldown Reduction on your Amulet, and 8% on your helmet, you would have the following cooldown reduction. All classes can get a class-specific version of this stat through tempering. These tempered stats can only be applied to your jewelry and only work for that particular skill. Cooldown Reduction is capped at 75% regardless of the source of the Cooldown Reduction. This stat can roll on Jewelry, Gloves, and Weapons. They can also be obtained through tempering your Jewelry. As the name suggests, it reduces the cost of your skills. Unlike Cooldown Reduction, Resource Cost Reduction stacks multiplicatively with each source. Nearly every item can give you extra ranks in a certain Skill or even in an entire skill category, such as (Sorcerer Only) or (Rogue Only). These ranks work the same way as the ones you put in your , usually increasing the skill's damage by 10% of its rank 1 value or decreasing its Cooldown. This stat gives a flat bonus to your Maximum Resource. It can roll on Amulets and Helmets. This stat increases the amount of Resources you get from any source, including passive regeneration, your Basic Skills, and different passive or Legendary Aspects. It can be applied to Jewelry through the tempering system. Resource Generation stacks multiplicatively with itself and with On your Boots and Amulet, you can get a +% Movement Speed affix. As expected, it makes you run faster. Your total Movement Speed can not exceed 200%. You can also get this effect from tempering and specific unique items in the game. On high-level legendary Boots, you can find some special stats listed separately from all the others. You can get one of three effects on each item: This stat can now only be obtained through and tempering. It increases the duration of all Crowd Control effects you apply to enemies. These effects include Slow, Chill, Daze, Stun, Freeze, Immobilize, Taunt, and Knock Down. This stat is found through tempering and it reduces the duration of Crowd Control effects that enemies apply to you. Thorns is a special \"offensive\" stat that lets you deal damage to enemies when they hit you. Damage dealt is increased by your primary Core Stat. Thorns can roll on Helmets, Chests, Pants, and Shields, and you can also boost your Thorns with certain skills and passives. In Diablo 4, there are a lot of stats you can get from items, passives, and even skills. These stats improve your character in different ways, and stacking the correct stats is pivotal for your success in the game."
