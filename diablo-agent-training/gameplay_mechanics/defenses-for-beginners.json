    "content": "In Diablo 4, dealing damage is the most important thing for dealing with Hell's minions, but you shouldn't forget about your defense. After all, staying alive is necessary to deal any damage at all. In this article, we dive into different stats and mechanics that help you protect yourself even against the toughest minions of hell. The most basic way to increase your total defense. Your Life stat measures how alive you are. When it hits 0, you die, and at that point, the only thing you can do is respawn at the last checkpoint or get revived by your You get some Base Life for leveling up, starting at 20 Life at level 1, and up to 400 Life at level 60. There are several other ways to increase your Maximum Life: Here is the formula for calculating Life Total: There are also a few different ways to restore your life after you take damage. First of all, every class has access to . Using one will instantly restore some flat amount of your Life (based on the level of the Healing Vial) and also 35% of your Maximum Life over the next 3 seconds. You can store several charges at once (boosted by the ), and you regain these charges by killing enemies or damaging Elites and Bosses past a certain threshold. Other than Healing Vials, there are some more ways to restore Life: On top of that, you can boost all these different ways of gaining Life with the Healing Received stat, which can be rolled on Helmets, Chest, and Pants, and also comes from Skulls socketed into armor. Life On Kill and Life Regeneration bonuses are very weak compared to the damage you take, so unless your build can make very good use of the few skills and passives that can restore Life, you will be healing mostly with Healing Vials. is a mechanic very similar to Life, except it only lasts for a certain duration. When you take damage, it first depletes your and then the remainder goes into Life. When you have multiple their amount is added together, but the duration of each is tracked separately. When one of your expires, your total goes down. Your total Barrier cannot exceed your Maximum Life. Here are several methods, although not an exhaustive list, to gain You can increase the amount of you get from any source with the Barrier Generation, such as from tempering and socketed into armor. However, since nearly every scales with your Maximum Life, it's usually better to just focus on your Life to make your stronger. Keep in mind, damage reduction while Fortified does not apply to Barriers. If you plan on using Barrier as a main source of survivability, adjust accordingly. Armor is one of your main ways of reducing damage. You get Armor from every armor piece and its amount scales linearly with the item's power. Additionally, you also get 0.2 Armor for each point of Strength. Furthermore, you can increase your Armor by socketing into Jewelry. All these sources of flat Armor can be increased by percentage-based bonuses on your Amulet, from tempering, and Armor reduces all incoming damage by a percentage based on your total Armor and the level of your character. As of patch 2.0.2, armor is now capped at 1000 at level 60. Armor's damage reduction scales exponentially with your Armor, meaning that instead of having 42.5% Damage Reduction with 500 armor, you have roughly 24% Damage Reduction. This damage reduction cannot exceed 85%, meaning that your Armor has an effective cap, but the amount of Armor you need to gain 1% damage reduction keeps increasing as you (and your enemies) level up. As of patch 2.0.2, you need 1000 armor to be armor-capped in the content you are doing. However, something introduced in this patch was that Torment difficulty reduces your armor by 250-1000 from Torment 1 to 4. This means that to do Torment 4, your character needs a total of 2000 armor, as 1000 is removed for playing in Torment 4. Once you have 1000 armor in the difficulty you are playing, you no longer need to worry about it until you increase the difficulty. To reduce Elemental ( ) damage, you need to stack corresponding Elemental Resistances. Unlike Armor, Resistances don't come as an enigmatic number that transforms into damage reduction percentage through a complicated level-based formula. Instead, Resistances come as a percentage already. Some things to note about them: The most important way to reduce incoming damage is Damage Reduction. This stat comes in a certain percentage and does exactly what it says: reduces all incoming damage by that percentage if the conditions are met. You can get damage reduction from: Damage Reduction stacks multiplicatively. That doesn't mean that Damage Reduction becomes less effective as you stack it. If you get a new effect that gives you 20% Damage Reduction, you will take 20% less damage than without this effect, simple as that. What it does mean is that it's impossible to become invincible just by stacking Damage Reduction. The only time when Damage Reduction stacks additively is when it comes from the same source. For example, when you put multiple ranks into the Sorcerer passive, or when using the Rogue skill , which gives up to 5 shrouding shadows and a stacking Damage Reduction value for each shadow you have. Barbarians, Druids, and Necromancers have access to a unique source of Damage Reduction that comes with its own set of mechanics to increase their defense. There are several skills, passives, and that can give you some amount of . When your is greater than or equal to your current Life, you become characters have 15% Damage Reduction. This number can be increased by the passive. When you are , incoming damage reduces both your Life and your by the same amount.  Keep in mind, Damage Reduction while does not interact with the damage taken to your Barriers. When you are hit by any attack you have a chance to dodge it, completely nullifying all damage and other harmful effects. You can't dodge individual ticks of Damage over Time (DoT) effects, but you can dodge the initial attack and prevent the DoT from being applied to you in the first place. Certain attacks should be dodgeable but are not currently, such as certain boss attacks. There are a few ways to get dodge chance: Much like Damage Reduction, Dodge Chance from affixes and tempering stacks inverse multiplicatively, but Dodge Chance from Dexterity and sources such as are additive. This makes it possible to reach 100% Dodge Chance with enough investment. Here is the formula for calculating Dodge Chance: Understanding how defense works in Diablo 4 is very important if you want to spend your time slaying monsters rather than decorating the carpet. To put it simply, defense comes down to stacking your Life and/or , building Armor and Resistances, as well as lots of different kinds of Damage Reduction and not chugging Healing Vials like your life depends on it (because it does)."

This stat comes in a certain percentage and does exactly what it says: reduces all incoming damage by that percentage if the conditions are met. You can get damage reduction from: Damage Reduction stacks multiplicatively. That doesn't mean that Damage Reduction becomes less effective as you stack it. If you get a new effect that gives you 20% Damage Reduction, you will take 20% less damage than without this effect, simple as that. What it does mean is that it's impossible to become invincible just by stacking Damage Reduction. The only time when Damage Reduction stacks additively is when it comes from the same source. For example, when you put multiple ranks into the Sorcerer passive, or when using the Rogue skill , which gives up to 5 shrouding shadows and a stacking Damage Reduction value for each shadow you have. Barbarians, Druids, and Necromancers have access to a unique source of Damage Reduction that comes with its own set of mechanics to increase their defense. There are several skills, passives, and that can give you some amount of . When your is greater than or equal to your current Life, you become characters have 15% Damage Reduction. This number can be increased by the passive. When you are , incoming damage reduces both your Life and your by the same amount.  Keep in mind, Damage Reduction while does not interact with the damage taken to your Barriers. When you are hit by any attack you have a chance to dodge it, completely nullifying all damage and other harmful effects. You can't dodge individual ticks of Damage over Time (DoT) effects, but you can dodge the initial attack and prevent the DoT from being applied to you in the first place. Certain attacks should be dodgeable but are not currently, such as certain boss attacks. There are a few ways to get dodge chance: Much like Damage Reduction, Dodge Chance from affixes and tempering stacks inverse multiplicatively, but Dodge Chance from Dexterity and sources such as are additive. This makes it possible to reach 100% Dodge Chance with enough investment. Here is the formula for calculating Dodge Chance: Understanding how defense works in Diablo 4 is very important if you want to spend your time slaying monsters rather than decorating the carpet. To put it simply, defense comes down to stacking your Life and/or , building Armor and Resistances, as well as lots of different kinds of Damage Reduction and not chugging Healing Vials like your life depends on it (because it does)."

Keep in mind, damage reduction while Fortified does not apply to Barriers. If you plan on using Barrier as a main source of survivability, adjust accordingly. Armor is one of your main ways of reducing damage. You get Armor from every armor piece and its amount scales linearly with the item's power. Additionally, you also get 0.2 Armor for each point of Strength. Furthermore, you can increase your Armor by socketing into Jewelry. All these sources of flat Armor can be increased by percentage-based bonuses on your Amulet, from tempering, and Armor reduces all incoming damage by a percentage based on your total Armor and the level of your character. As of patch 2.0.2, armor is now capped at 1000 at level 60. Armor's damage reduction scales exponentially with your Armor, meaning that instead of having 42.5% Damage Reduction with 500 armor, you have roughly 24% Damage Reduction. This damage reduction cannot exceed 85%, meaning that your Armor has an effective cap, but the amount of Armor you need to gain 1% damage reduction keeps increasing as you (and your enemies) level up. As of patch 2.0.2, you need 1000 armor to be armor-capped in the content you are doing. However, something introduced in this patch was that Torment difficulty reduces your armor by 250-1000 from Torment 1 to 4. This means that to do Torment 4, your character needs a total of 2000 armor, as 1000 is removed for playing in Torment 4. Once you have 1000 armor in the difficulty you are playing, you no longer need to worry about it until you increase the difficulty.
