    "content": "Powering Up focuses on some of the most meaningful components of your character's progression in Diablo 4. No matter what activity you decide to engage with, you always accumulate the materials, experience, gear, and gold necessary to develop a fully decked-out endgame character. Our aim is to help you better manage those resources and prioritize certain progression paths to keep your character at its strongest. Early on, it's unlikely to be fully equipped with Items, let alone the best-in-slot necessary to strengthen or even enable your endgame build. This gear can drop randomly from virtually any source, but here are a few tips to help better target the items you need: Starting in Season 4, the Season Journey rewards players with Items that are themed around a Skill or playstyle for each class. While some builds are better than others, getting any form of guaranteed is better than known, especially if some or most can be carried over to a more desirable build. For Season 6 - Season of the Hatred Rising, the following archetypes are what each class focused on: As of Season 4, all possible are available to be items in the . Each Dungeon still has the same associated as before that you need to unlock by completing the Dungeon. Now, when you find a previously drop only item, you can go to the it to add the power (at its current strength) to the Codex of Power! This allows any power to be added and Imprinted over and over again without having to hoard Aspect Crystals any longer. from Reward Chests at the end of and Dungeon Events allows for one of the best methods to target specific not found in the Codex. To spend these, visit the in any of the capital cities to gamble for particular item slots. When choosing which item slot to gamble, it's important to understand which category a particular belongs to. This determines what slot you should gamble. As an example, Resource Aspects can only be found or Imprinted onto Rings and Amulets, while Offensive Aspects can be found on Weapons, Off-hands, Gloves, Rings, or Amulets. Once you've mastered this concept, it becomes easier to spend your in a way that maximizes your chances of obtaining a key Similar to gambling at the Purveyor of Curiosities, Collections acquired from the include gear from your choice of three random item slots. In higher difficulties, this gear often includes one or more Items. This is how you get your first Sigils for , too! The upshot of farming for Collections is that many of these objectives coincide with other productive activities, including World Bosses, Local Events, and Dungeons. To maximize efficiency, consider prioritizing content that overlaps with Whispers of the Dead objectives to kill two birds with one stone. Certain zones in a region periodically become corrupted by . Enemies that spawn within these zones drop , which you can use to unlock chests in the affected zones called Tortured Gifts. The gear from these chests is slot-specific and much rarer, often including items. Make the most of these events for gear upgrades and crafting materials as well. As you progress into better and more permanent pieces of gear, you want to devote your gathered resources towards improving those items you intend to keep. Even early on, investing a little bit in improving your gear at the can make a noticeable difference as you level. There are a handful of ways that items can be improved: Progressing in each of the game's 6 regions grants you a set of account-wide unlocks. This includes increases to your maximum Potion Charges and capacity, and precious Skill and Paragon Points. By late game, these additional points prove invaluable, so it's never a bad idea to work on your Renown as you traverse through each region. Note that you don't need to fully complete all 6 activities that contribute to Renown to receive the maximum benefit from that region. One of the most efficient ways to progress a region's Renown while boosting your character power is by discovering . These Altars provide permanent, account-wide bonuses to Life, Attributes, maximum capacity, and even Paragon Points! Consequently, many players seek these Altars even after they've already completely unlocked the Renown bonuses in each region. Discovering Altars of Lilith, by itself, doesn't provide enough Renown to fully unlock a region's bonuses, but picking them up along the way saves you from backtracking later. After advancing to Torment difficulties, provide an extraordinary source of power that scales throughout the endgame. When placed in a Glyph Socket on your , they grant a wide array of offensive, defensive, or utility-based stats that are either unattainable through other means or dwarf comparable sources of the same bonus. Glyphs are found in any activity in Torment Difficulties. They are leveled by completing , which solidifies this as the cornerstone endgame activity. Obtaining Glyphs is still random and may take some time to acquire all you need for your build, so be patient and they will eventually appear. With each level, the effectiveness of Glyphs' inherent bonuses scales higher. At Level 15, expand from a Radius of 3 to 4, and at Level 46, and expand their Radius of 4 to 5. The increase in Radius determines the number of Paragon Nodes that they can affect (or those that affect them). Level 15 proves to be the turning point for leveling most Glyphs, as some Paragon Board Glyph Sockets require a Radius of 4 to fully unlock, dipping into the nearby Nodes. As such, we recommend leveling each you intend to use to at least Level 15 before moving on to the next. When all of your Glyphs have reached this threshold, then consider progressing them to their next Radius increase at 46. In Diablo 4, the selected difficulty dictates whether or not you can obtain the most rare items in the game. As you progress through the higher difficulties, upgrading your items to these higher rarities is a top priority. The effects of some Unique items are build-enabling, and those that aren't are still impactful. The processes by which we acquire these items are the same.

By late game, these additional points prove invaluable, so it's never a bad idea to work on your Renown as you traverse through each region.

Consequently, many players seek these Altars even after they've already completely unlocked the Renown bonuses in each region.

With each level, the effectiveness of Glyphs' inherent bonuses scales higher. At Level 15, expand from a Radius of 3 to 4, and at Level 46, and expand their Radius of 4 to 5. The increase in Radius determines the number of Paragon Nodes that they can affect (or those that affect them). Level 15 proves to be the turning point for leveling most Glyphs, as some Paragon Board Glyph Sockets require a Radius of 4 to fully unlock, dipping into the nearby Nodes.

This includes increases to your maximum Potion Charges and capacity, and precious Skill and Paragon Points. By late game, these additional points prove invaluable, so it's never a bad idea to work on your Renown as you traverse through each region. Note that you don't need to fully complete all 6 activities that contribute to Renown to receive the maximum benefit from that region. One of the most efficient ways to progress a region's Renown while boosting your character power is by discovering . These Altars provide permanent, account-wide bonuses to Life, Attributes, maximum capacity, and even Paragon Points! Consequently, many players seek these Altars even after they've already completely unlocked the Renown bonuses in each region. Discovering Altars of Lilith, by itself, doesn't provide enough Renown to fully unlock a region's bonuses, but picking them up along the way saves you from backtracking later.

Obtaining Glyphs is still random and may take some time to acquire all you need for your build, so be patient and they will eventually appear. With each level, the effectiveness of Glyphs' inherent bonuses scales higher. At Level 15, expand from a Radius of 3 to 4, and at Level 46, and expand their Radius of 4 to 5. The increase in Radius determines the number of Paragon Nodes that they can affect (or those that affect them). Level 15 proves to be the turning point for leveling most Glyphs, as some Paragon Board Glyph Sockets require a Radius of 4 to fully unlock, dipping into the nearby Nodes. As such, we recommend leveling each you intend to use to at least Level 15 before moving on to the next. When all of your Glyphs have reached this threshold, then consider progressing them to their next Radius increase at 46. In Diablo 4, the selected difficulty dictates whether or not you can obtain the most rare items in the game.
