    "content": "The Vendors offer a variety of options for improving your character in meaningful ways! The Vendors include the Alchemist, Blacksmith, Purveyor, Jeweler, and Occultist. All of these Vendors are found in the main city of Kyovashad, but some additional Vendors may be found in the outlying villages and encampments you may encounter on your journey. Gather some , and return to stay awhile and listen to these Vendors. The Armory allows you to save your character's build and armor, quickly changing between different setups. At the Armory, you save your current equipment, skills, paragon points, and glyphs. This allows you to alter your character's loadout to fit the content you are about to challenge in Sanctuary. The Alchemist is where you can spend your hard-earned gold and crafting materials to upgrade your Healing Potions and Craft Elixirs. This is the vendor you go to see when you want to maximize your longevity in combat. Stop in and have the Alchemist improve your Healing Vial, so you heal more per potion, or brew Elixirs for a buff to your Stats. The Blacksmith provides you with options to upgrade your gear, salvage unwanted gear, and repair your items. Upgrade your gear through Tempering and Masterworking, making it even stronger. Salvaging gear will supply you with some crafting materials for future upgrades. Repairing will only cost you Gold to get your item's durability back to full. The Jeweler can be visited to craft Gem upgrades and add gems to your sockets on your gear for a powerful stat increase. Stats on the Gems include adding more Damage, Resistances, Armor, Core Stats, or Utility to the socketable item. You may also unsocket your Gems without losing them and reuse them at another time. The Occultist is the vendor for enchanting gear to change the stat rolls and craft Sigils which are required to open . In addition, you can imprint gear to customize your build with powerful effects. After the Blacksmith, the Occultist is your next best friend in Diablo 4. This vendor is a huge Gold sink, so come prepared! The Purveyor is here to satisfy those gambling needs. Spend your Obols at this vendor to receive randomly rolled items for a chance at the best gear in the game! You can gamble an item to fill out any for the potential at upgrading to your current gear or gear that allows another skill build you may want to try out in the future. This is also a great way to target farm-specific you may need for your build. Maintained by"
