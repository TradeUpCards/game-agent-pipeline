    "content": "HP: ~24,000,000 Stagger HP: 500 HP: ~40,000,000 Stagger HP: 200 Echo of Lilith is an optional Boss in Diablo 4 accessible after unlocking Torment Difficulties by reaching level 60 and clearing the Pit level 20. Players can fight her by entering the Echo of Hatred dungeon in the church of Nevesk. Defeating Echo of Lilith for the first time grants the player \"Silence is Hellish\" challenge, \"Lilith's\" title, Reins of the Bloody Liquid Steed, and two items of or above quality. Defeating the boss again grants no rewards except two items, which can be claimed once per character. Before you take on this boss, you need to make sure that your build is sufficiently strong. You should have at the very least 1 million DPS, otherwise the fight will take too long and the ever-growing, unavoidable damage from Blood Orb Creation will make it impossible. Lilith has 2 kinds of attacks: normal attacks and one-shot attacks. The former are no more dangerous than any regular level 100 boss; if your build can do Helltides and Dungeons, you will be just fine. The latter, however, will outright one-shot you and while some builds can get tanky enough to survive one such hit, for most it's a faraway dream. It's best to dodge these attacks and invest more into your damage. And this brings us to the most important stat you need for this encounter - Movement Speed. With base 100% Movement Speed, the wrong Boot implicit, and no mobility skills, many of Lilith's attacks become outright unavoidable. With a couple of Movement Speed rolls on your Boots and Amulet plus extra Evade charges, you can dodge everything she throws at you. Add in some mobility skills like and maybe an invulnerability button like and it becomes almost easy. Get at least 140% Movement Speed and either \"Max Evade Charges\" or \"Movement Speed after Evade\" roll on your boots. Similar to the Tormented Bosses of the Boss Ladder system, Lilith applies a stacking damage taken debuff to the player when hit by certain abilities. This allows a few mistakes throughout the fight before the incoming damage overwhelms you. These abilities are: It's advised to spec into a proper Bossing setup to complete the fight. Check out our to see the best builds! Lilith siphons the blood out of the player, dealing unavoidable damage and creating a Volatile Blood beneath their feet. At the same time, 3 Dancing Blood Orbs are created, which orbit the player's position for 5 seconds and then swiftly fly out of the arena. Getting hit by a Dancing Blood Orb deals minor damage and makes the player Vulnerable for 2.5 seconds.  This attack applies a stacking debuff to the player, which increases its damage by 2% per stack. The initial hit applies 2 stacks and each Dancing Blood Orb applies 1 stack on hit. is a common enemy with 1,200,000 HP. If not killed within 12 seconds, Volatile Blood erupts, dealing lethal damage in room-wide AoE. When Lilith is below 40% HP, this attack creates two Volatile Bloods. The initial hit is unavoidable its damage grows over time, so you need to have enough DPS to end the fight before you accumulate too many stacks of this debuff. Try to kill Volatile Blood as soon as possible. If you fail to do it in time, only abilities that make you can save you. Lilith takes 2 steps forward while striking the player twice with her wings. If the player is too far away, Lilith shadowsteps closer to them at the beginning of this attack. This attack can be easily outranged or side-stepped, but its damage is so low that most builds can just facetank it and use it as an opportunity to deal damage. Lilith creates a series of parallel fissures on the ground which explode after a 1 second delay, dealing damage to players standing on top of them. This version is used when Lilith is above 70% HP. Don't stand in the fire if you want to avoid the damage, but, similar to Melee Combo, this ability's damage is low enough for most builds to simply ignore it. Lilith creates two series of parallel fissures on the ground in a criss-cross pattern. Fissures explode after a 1 second delay, dealing damage to players standing on top of them. Standing on the intersection of two fissures deals damage twice. This version is used when Lilith is below 70% HP. The damage this ability stays the same but double-hit can be dangerous to more squishy builds, so don't stand on the intersection of two lines. Lilith turns to face the player and then summons two shadow clones of herself. After a brief delay, Lilith and her clones jump backwards while launching forward a wide wave of demonic spikes that deals lethal damage on contact. The easiest way to dodge this attack is to simply move behind Lilith while she is preparing the wave. If Lilith's back is to the edge of the arena and you can't stand behind her, you need to run backwards and to the side to get out of the way. In some cases the wave can be aimed directly through the arena's center, making it impossible to dodge without leaving the circle. To prevent this from happening, never stand between Lilith and the center of the arena when you both are close to the edge. Lilith leaps upward, briefly leaving the arena. After a 1.2 second delay, 3 warning markers are created on the ground: one directly next to the player and two more to the sides and slightly back. One second later, Lilith's shadow clones come crashing down and launch 3 narrow waves of demonic spikes from the position of the markers. Finally, Lilith herself comes down, launching the 4th wave down the middle lane from further back. This version is available at all times. As soon as you see Lilith crouch before her jump, start moving to the edge of the arena. If you get there fast enough, all the launching spots of the waves will be inside the circle. Then all you have to do is run to the opposite side until you get behind the 4th warning marker. This way you are never in a path of any waves and you are also right next to the Lilith's landing spot, ready to deal damage. If you fail to get to the edge of the arena in time, the safe areas may land outside the circle. In that case you have to dodge the attack the hard way. Move to the side of the first marker to let the wave pass you by. As soon as it passes, immediately get behind it to avoid the incoming side wave. Again, as soon as side wave passes, go behind it again to avoid the final wave coming down the middle. Keep in mind that the hitbox of the waves is slightly in front of them (which is further exacerbated by your latency), meaning that you will get hit before the wave even touches you. On the bright side, that also means that back side of the wave is quite safe: if you approach a wave from behind you can literally stand on top of the spikes without taking damage. Lilith leaps upward, briefly leaving the arena. After a 1.2 second delay, 3 warning markers are created on the ground: one directly next to the player and two more to the sides and far behind. One second later, Lilith's shadow clones come crashing down and launch 3 narrow waves of demonic spikes from the position of the markers. Finally Lilith herself comes down, launching the 4th wave down the middle lane from further back. This version is available when Lilith is below 70% HP. The exact same strategy can be used for this version: run to the edge, wait for marker, run to to opposite side to get behind the 4th wave. Since you always stay in the middle lane you don't have to worry about side waves no matter what direction they go. If you fail to get to the edge of the arena in time, you need to dodge differently. Get behind the first marker and then run behind the wave as closely as you can. When the side waves pass by, get out of the middle to avoid the incoming last wave. If the first marker is at the edge of the circle and you can't get behind it, simply run backwards and to the side to get behind one of the side waves. In this version, there are 3 waves going along the sides of a triangle in clockwise direction. Lilith herself comes down in the center of the triangle, dealing lethal damage in large circular AoE. This version is available when Lilith is below 40% HP. The general method of dodging remains the same: you need to get to one side of the circle so that the attack is aimed off-center, and then quickly dash to the safe area on the opposite site. Keep in mind that that the waves continue traveling past the vertices of the triangle so the to be safe you need to be completely outside it. Unlike the previous two versions, this attack leaves you with less time to react since you need to get out of the central AoE quickly. If you fail to get to the edge of the arena in time, there might be no safe zones at all and then only Invulnerability can save you. This version also has only 3 first waves from the second version. Instead of launching 4th wave down the middle, Lilith comes down directly next to the player, dealing lethal damage in large circular AoE. This version is available when Lilith is below 40% HP. The general method of dodging remains the same: you need to get to one side of the circle so that the attack is aimed off-center, and then quickly dash to the safe area on the opposite site. If you stay in the middle lane while doing that, don't forget about incoming wave that will come a few seconds later. Move left or right when the side waves pass you. If you fail to get to the edge of the arena in time, there might be no safe zones at all and then only Invulnerability can save you. Lilith plunges her tail into the ground while siphoning blood out of the player at the same time, dealing unavoidable damage and creating 8 Dancing Blood Orbs going around the player in two concentric circles. After a brief delay an explosion of blood goes off next to the player dealing damage and creating a new Blood Orb in the center. All previously created Blood Orbs caught in the explosion are destroyed. Dancing Blood Orbs deal minor damage and make the player Vulnerable for 2.5 seconds upon impact. After orbiting the player's original position for 5 seconds, Dancing Blood Orbs swiftly fly out of the arena. In this phase, Blood Orbs are not enemies but obstacles on the map. Stepping into a Blood Orb deals low damage over time to the player and slows them. During certain attacks in this phase, Blood Orbs create deadly Red Souls that chase down the player. If Lilith is Staggered, all Blood Orbs except two (selected at random) are destroyed. This attack applies a stacking debuff to the player, which increases its damage by 2% per stack. The initial hit and the blood explosion apply 2 stacks and each Dancing Blood Orb applies 1 stack on hit. The initial hit is unavoidable. Its damage grows over time, so you need to have enough DPS to end the fight before you accumulate too many stacks of the debuff. The explosion deals high damage but it's easy to dodge with Evade if you remember it's coming. This version of the attack does the same initial damage and creates Dancing Blood Orbs, but instead of creating a single blood explosion next to the player 4 explosions happen in different corners of the arena and 4 Blood Orbs are created. This version is used at the beginning of the second phase when there are no active Blood Orbs on the arena. It can be skipped completely if you manage to take Lilith below 85% health before she spawns them, making this entire phase significantly easier. Lilith strikes the player 1-3 times with her tail. Similar to first phase, the damage of this attack is so low that most builds can just facetank it and use it as an opportunity to deal damage. Lilith flies up into the air and pulls all enemies towards herself while slowing them for 3 seconds. At the same time, she summons 4-6 (depending on her HP) Children of Lilith. After a 2 second delay, Lilith slams down onto the ground, dealing lethal damage in a large circle. Children of Lilith are a ghoul type enemies who pose no threat on their own but can become a source of Souls during certain attacks. If you get hit by the pull + slow you won't be able to get out of the AoE by just running. You need to use an ability to prevent the pull or to remove the slow. Alternatively, you can use a mobility skill or 2-3 Evade charges to get out even while slowed. After dodging, kill the Children before continuing to fight Lilith. Lilith lets out a scream, knocking the player back. After that, Lilith dashes towards the player and shoots a three-pronged fork of shadows at the player, which deals heavy damage. Then she does this dash + fork combo a second time. At the same time, a shadow clone of Lilith is created nearby, which mimics her initial scream and two fork attacks with a 1 second delay. After all 4 forks are shot, Lilith slams the ground near player's position, releasing a massive shadow explosion that deals lethal damage. If Lilith is killed or Staggered during this attack, the shadow clone will continue acting on its own. Since Lilith's death animation is very long, you will receive no rewards for double KO. Very tanky builds can survive a single hit by a fork, but most have to dodge this attack entirely. To do that, move away from Lilith and run in a large circle. Each fork's middle prong is always aimed directly at you, so you will always dodge it as long as you move laterally. In doing so, you risk running into one of the side prongs, so you need to either be far enough away from Lilith or slow down a bit after you dodge the middle one. When Lilith raises her wings before the final part of the attack, move quickly to the opposite side of the arena to avoid the explosion. Lilith flies up and leaves the arena. After a brief delay, she comes back flying across the entire battlefield, covering the ground behind her in a thick layer of cursed blood. After a 3 second delay, the blood ignites, dealing lethal damage to all enemies caught in it for the next 2 seconds. There's always a safe zone at the side of the arena where Lilith finishes her flight. This attack is trivial to dodge on it's own and only becomes dangerous when combined with Souls chasing down the player. Remember that no damage is done until the blood catches fire, so you don't need to rush into the safe zone immediately. After player enters the arena, Lilith will drop down in the center, knocking the player back and creating a Circle of Doom that limits the size of the playable area. Stepping outside of the circle will deal extremely high damage over time to the player. The fight always starts with the fixed sequence of attacks: After that she will select one of 5 attacks available to her: Lilith will always prioritize Blood Orb Creation if it's not on cooldown. She will never do Melee Combo more than twice in a row. Otherwise the attacks are selected at random. During this stage of the fight, Lilith has long cooldowns on her high-damage attacks, giving you plenty of time to damage her and/or apply Stagger. Be ready to dodge Wave of Spikes or Death From Above when they come and you should be able to get through this stage without much trouble. When Lilith's health goes below 70%, she will finish her attack and summon 2 Enforcers. After that, she will continuously use Death From Above as long as at least one of the Enforcers is alive (but no less than 2 times). Each Enforcer will leave behind 2 Volatile Bloods and  6 Health Potion charges upon death. Enforcers themselves deal almost no damage. Your primary focus should be on dodging the Death From Above spam while killing them. Stay at the edge of the arena and let the Enforcers come to you. Be mindful of their pull attack as it can move you into the one-shot attacks from Lilith. If your build is not great at cleaning up Volatile Blood, try to kill the minions one-by-one and kill the Blood in-between. After you kill both minions, the camera returns to the normal zoom level and the second stage of the fight begins. Lilith's abilities are upgraded: Her attacks, in general, will follow this pattern: Your best strategy is to focus on dodging during steps 1-3 and doing damage during step 4. Since her Blood Orb Creation now has reduced cooldown and still has highest priority, the attack in step 2 will often be Blood Orb Creation. It's recommended to focus on dodging the incoming Death From Above first and killing Volatile Bloods second. Since Volatile Bloods take 12 seconds to detonate, you have plenty of time to kill it without the threat of a one-shot hanging over you. When Lilith's health goes below 40%, she will finish her attack and summon 3 Oppressors. Same as the first minion phase, she will spam use Death From Above as long as her minions live. This phase is not very different from the first one. Now there are 3 minions instead of 2 but they pose little threat and all the danger is coming from now further upgraded Death From Above. Our strategy stays the same: focus on dodging first and killing second. After the minions die, the fight continues with more improvements to Lilith's attacks: During this stage Lilith will simply use Death From Above after every 2-3 attacks giving you little time to deal damage. Stay at the edge of the arena at all times to make dodging easier and slowly work through her HP bar. When Lilith's HP hits 0, the circle created at the start of the fight will disappear and 20 seconds later Echo of Lilith, Mother of Mankind will spawn in the center. Lilith opens up the fight with a semi-fixed sequence of attacks: After that she behaves similar to her first phase. She casts Blood Orb Creation whenever its 15s cooldown is ready and otherwise randomly chooses between Melee Combo, Flight (~20s cooldown), and Shadow Clone (~20s cooldown). During this part of the fight, the only threatening attack Lilith has is Shadow Clone, but with plenty of space to dodge it, you can always run in a big circle and be completely fine. Instead, you should focus at dealing damage and managing Blood Orbs. When the Blood Orb Creation is coming up, move next to (or even inside of) one of the existing Blood Orbs to make sure that their numbers don't increase. Staggering Lilith at this stage is also beneficial as it will destroy some of the Blood Orbs. Alternatively, you can just run to the top of the arena to spawn new Blood Orbs, as this section of the arena will soon be destroyed. This, however, makes the next phase transition very hard to survive, so only do this if you have an Invulnerability skill to help you. After Lilith's HP falls below 85% she will finish her current attack and use Flight (bottom to top). After that, she performs a special move (Lilith can't be Staggered during this time) where she uses her wings to destroy part of the arena. This section overlaps with the safe zone of previously used Flight and players standing on it take minor damage over time. 6 seconds later, the cut-off section crumbles down into the abyss, instantly killing all players standing on it. While the platform is crumbling and for 2 second after, Blood Orbs shoot Souls at the player. 2 Souls are created each second, regardless of the number of currently active Blood Orbs. Souls move at ~133% Movement Speed and home in on their target, but their turn speed is very low, making it possible to sidestep them. Souls deal heavy damage on contact. After the platform is broken, Lilith teleports to the center of arena and uses Ground Slam. Dodging all these attacks can be tricky but it becomes much easier if you can outrun the Souls. Then you just have to run in a large circle, timing it in such a way that you enter the crumbling platform right before the blood on the floor starts burning, and then leave it before it falls down, all without stopping. In this case, you only have to worry about the Souls coming straight at you and you Evade or simply take a step to the side to dodge them. Be aware that the pull from the Ground Slam attack will happen while there's still some Souls out, so you need to make sure that there are no Souls between you and arena's center when it happens (or simply use Unstoppable ability to prevent the pull). The second stage of the fight is no different from the first one, but now Lilith has one more ability to choose from: Ground Slam. The next stage begins when Lilith HP falls below 60% mark. Lilith will once again open up with Flight (bottom left to top right) and then will start breaking off the corner of the platform. Unlike the first time, the safe zone of Flight doesn't perfectly overlap with the crumbling platform and there's some burning blood in the left corner of it. There's nothing different in the way you dodge this attack but it's a bit more difficult because the safe zone and the arena itself is now smaller. After the platform is broken, Lilith will teleport to the center and use Ground Slam. During this stage of the fight, Lilith doesn't gain any new abilities but she gets some upgrades: When Lilith falls below 30% HP, she will break the last corner of the platform, starting with Flight (bottom right to top left), then platform break with all the bells whistles and Souls. As she destroys the last platform, she will cast Shadow Clone. After this, the fight continues but Lilith now has no cooldown on her Flight ability and will often use it twice in a row in opposite directions, forcing you to run from one end of the arena to the other and stand in a tiny safe zone while dodging all the Souls coming for you. On top of that, the arena itself is so small now that you barely have space to dodge her Ground Slam and Shadow Clone attacks. Needless to say, staying alive and dealing damage is extremely difficult so it's recommended to Stagger Lilith either right before or right after the last transition and then deal as much damage as possible to shorten this stage of the fight or even outright kill her. The above description of the fight tells you what happens if you slowly and steadily deal damage to Lilith and she has plenty of time to perform all her special attacks. Things can be very different if your damage is overwhelmingly high and certain parts of the fight can be outright skipped. For example, if you deal 60% of Lilith's HP in one hit at the beginning of the fight, she will go up and then come down to summon Oppressors, and you will never have to fight any Enforcers. Now, most builds can't do that kind of damage but that's where Stagger comes in. Staggering Lilith lets you deal damage to her for 5 seconds uninterrupted and many builds can deal serious damage during that timeframe. If you Stagger her before she gets below 70% HP and then kill her before Stagger ends, you skip the most difficult parts of the first phase. If you manage to build stagger fast enough to Stagger her during the opening sequence of attacks, then you can finish the fight without dodging once. Depending on your damage output you can aim to stagger her at different HP thresholds: To manipulate the moment when Stagger happens you need to adjust the amount of stagger damage your build deals. There's two ways to do that: If you lack the damage to skip parts of the fight within one stagger, you can swap your gear during the fight. For example, you can use to build up Stagger and then switch to offensive gloves and during the Stagger. Reviewed by"

Lilith flies up into the air and pulls all enemies towards herself while slowing them for 3 seconds. At the same time, she summons 4-6 (depending on her HP) Children of Lilith. After a 2 second delay, Lilith slams down onto the ground, dealing lethal damage in a large circle. Children of Lilith are a ghoul type enemies who pose no threat on their own but can become a source of Souls during certain attacks. If you get hit by the pull + slow you won't be able to get out of the AoE by just running. You need to use an ability to prevent the pull or to remove the slow. Alternatively, you can use a mobility skill or 2-3 Evade charges to get out even while slowed. After dodging, kill the Children before continuing to fight Lilith. Lilith lets out a scream, knocking the player back. After that, Lilith dashes towards the player and shoots a three-pronged fork of shadows at the player, which deals heavy damage. Then she does this dash + fork combo a second time. At the same time, a shadow clone of Lilith is created nearby, which mimics her initial scream and two fork attacks with a 1 second delay. After all 4 forks are shot, Lilith slams the ground near player's position, releasing a massive shadow explosion that deals lethal damage. If Lilith is killed or Staggered during this attack, the shadow clone will continue acting on its own. Since Lilith's death animation is very long, you will receive no rewards for double KO. Very tanky builds can survive a single hit by a fork, but most have to dodge this attack entirely. To do that, move away from Lilith and run in a large circle. Each fork's middle prong is always aimed directly at you, so you will always dodge it as long as you move laterally. In doing so, you risk running into one of the side prongs, so you need to either be far enough away from Lilith or slow down a bit after you dodge the middle one. When Lilith raises her wings before the final part of the attack, move quickly to the opposite side of the arena to avoid the explosion. Lilith flies up and leaves the arena. After a brief delay, she comes back flying across the entire battlefield, covering the ground behind her in a thick layer of cursed blood. After a 3 second delay, the blood ignites, dealing lethal damage to all enemies caught in it for the next 2 seconds. There's always a safe zone at the side of the arena where Lilith finishes her flight. This attack is trivial to dodge on it's own and only becomes dangerous when combined with Souls chasing down the player. Remember that no damage is done until the blood catches fire, so you don't need to rush into the safe zone immediately. After player enters the arena, Lilith will drop down in the center, knocking the player back and creating a Circle of Doom that limits the size of the playable area. Stepping outside of the circle will deal extremely high damage over time to the player. The fight always starts with the fixed sequence of attacks: After that she will select one of 5 attacks available to her: Lilith will always prioritize Blood Orb Creation if it's not on cooldown. She will never do Melee Combo more than twice in a row. Otherwise the attacks are selected at random. During this stage of the fight, Lilith has long cooldowns on her high-damage attacks, giving you plenty of time to damage her and/or apply Stagger. Be ready to dodge Wave of Spikes or Death From Above when they come and you should be able to get through this stage without much trouble. When Lilith's health goes below 70%, she will finish her attack and summon 2 Enforcers. After that, she will continuously use Death From Above as long as at least one of the Enforcers is alive (but no less than 2 times). Each Enforcer will leave behind 2 Volatile Bloods and  6 Health Potion charges upon death. Enforcers themselves deal almost no damage. Your primary focus should be on dodging the Death From Above spam while killing them. Stay at the edge of the arena and let the Enforcers come to you. Be mindful of their pull attack as it can move you into the one-shot attacks from Lilith. If your build is not great at cleaning up Volatile Blood, try to kill the minions one-by-one and kill the Blood in-between. After you kill both minions, the camera returns to the normal zoom level and the second stage of the fight begins. Lilith's abilities are upgraded: Her attacks, in general, will follow this pattern: Your best strategy is to focus on dodging during steps 1-3 and doing damage during step 4. Since her Blood Orb Creation now has reduced cooldown and still has highest priority, the attack in step 2 will often be Blood Orb Creation. It's recommended to focus on dodging the incoming Death From Above first and killing Volatile Bloods second. Since Volatile Bloods take 12 seconds to detonate, you have plenty of time to kill it without the threat of a one-shot hanging over you. When Lilith's health goes below 40%, she will finish her attack and summon 3 Oppressors. Same as the first minion phase, she will spam use Death From Above as long as her minions live. This phase is not very different from the first one. Now there are 3 minions instead of 2 but they pose little threat and all the danger is coming from now further upgraded Death From Above. Our strategy stays the same: focus on dodging first and killing second. After the minions die, the fight continues with more improvements to Lilith's attacks: During this stage Lilith will simply use Death From Above after every 2-3 attacks giving you little time to deal damage. Stay at the edge of the arena at all times to make dodging easier and slowly work through her HP bar. When Lilith's HP hits 0, the circle created at the start of the fight will disappear and 20 seconds later Echo of Lilith, Mother of Mankind will spawn in the center. Lilith opens up the fight with a semi-fixed sequence of attacks: After that she behaves similar to her first phase. She casts Blood Orb Creation whenever its 15s cooldown is ready and otherwise randomly chooses between Melee Combo, Flight (~20s cooldown), and Shadow Clone (~20s cooldown). During this part of the fight, the only threatening attack Lilith has is Shadow Clone, but with plenty of space to dodge it, you can always run in a big circle and be completely fine. Instead, you should focus at dealing damage and managing Blood Orbs. When the Blood Orb Creation is coming up, move next to (or even inside of) one of the existing Blood Orbs to make sure that their numbers don't increase. Staggering Lilith at this stage is also beneficial as it will destroy some of the Blood Orbs. Alternatively, you can just run to the top of the arena to spawn new Blood Orbs, as this section of the arena will soon be destroyed. This, however, makes the next phase transition very hard to survive, so only do this if you have an Invulnerability skill to help you. After Lilith's HP falls below 85% she will finish her current attack and use Flight (bottom to top). After that, she performs a special move (Lilith can't be Staggered during this time) where she uses her wings to destroy part of the arena. This section overlaps with the safe zone of previously used Flight and players standing on it take minor damage over time. 6 seconds later, the cut-off section crumbles down into the abyss, instantly killing all players standing on it. While the platform is crumbling and for 2 second after, Blood Orbs shoot Souls at the player. 2 Souls are created each second, regardless of the number of currently active Blood Orbs. Souls move at ~133% Movement Speed and home in on their target, but their turn speed is very low, making it possible to sidestep them. Souls deal heavy damage on contact. After the platform is broken, Lilith teleports to the center of arena and uses Ground Slam. Dodging all these attacks can be tricky but it becomes much easier if you can outrun the Souls. Then you just have to run in a large circle, timing it in such a way that you enter the crumbling platform right before the blood on the floor starts burning, and then leave it before it falls down, all without stopping. In this case, you only have to worry about the Souls coming straight at you and you Evade or simply take a step to the side to dodge them. Be aware that the pull from the Ground Slam attack will happen while there's still some Souls out, so you need to make sure that there are no Souls between you and arena's center when it happens (or simply use Unstoppable ability to prevent the pull). The second stage of the fight is no different from the first one, but now Lilith has one more ability to choose from: Ground Slam. The next stage begins when Lilith HP falls below 60% mark. Lilith will once again open up with Flight (bottom left to top right) and then will start breaking off the corner of the platform. Unlike the first time, the safe zone of Flight doesn't perfectly overlap with the crumbling platform and there's some burning blood in the left corner of it. There's nothing different in the way you dodge this attack but it's a bit more difficult because the safe zone and the arena itself is now smaller. After the platform is broken, Lilith will teleport to the center and use Ground Slam. During this stage of the fight, Lilith doesn't gain any new abilities but she gets some upgrades: When Lilith falls below 30% HP, she will break the last corner of the platform, starting with Flight (bottom right to top left), then platform break with all the bells whistles and Souls. As she destroys the last platform, she will cast Shadow Clone. After this, the fight continues but Lilith now has no cooldown on her Flight ability and will often use it twice in a row in opposite directions, forcing you to run from one end of the arena to the other and stand in a tiny safe zone while dodging all the Souls coming for you. On top of that, the arena itself is so small now that you barely have space to dodge her Ground Slam and Shadow Clone attacks. Needless to say, staying alive and dealing damage is extremely difficult so it's recommended to Stagger Lilith either right before or right after the last transition and then deal as much damage as possible to shorten this stage of the fight or even outright kill her. The above description of the fight tells you what happens if you slowly and steadily deal damage to Lilith and she has plenty of time to perform all her special attacks. Things can be very different if your damage is overwhelmingly high and certain parts of the fight can be outright skipped. For example, if you deal 60% of Lilith's HP in one hit at the beginning of the fight, she will go up and then come down to summon Oppressors, and you will never have to fight any Enforcers. Now, most builds can't do that kind of damage but that's where Stagger comes in. Staggering Lilith lets you deal damage to her for 5 seconds uninterrupted and many builds can deal serious damage during that timeframe. If you Stagger her before she gets below 70% HP and then kill her before Stagger ends, you skip the most difficult parts of the first phase. If you manage to build stagger fast enough to Stagger her during the opening sequence of attacks, then you can finish the fight without dodging once. Depending on your damage output you can aim to stagger her at different HP thresholds: To manipulate the moment when Stagger happens you need to adjust the amount of stagger damage your build deals. There's two ways to do that: If you lack the damage to skip parts of the fight within one stagger, you can swap your gear during the fight. For example, you can use to build up Stagger and then switch to offensive gloves and during the Stagger. Reviewed by"

    "content": "HP: ~40,000,000 Stagger HP: 200 Echo of Lilith is an optional Boss in Diablo 4 accessible after unlocking Torment Difficulties by reaching level 60 and clearing the Pit level 20. Players can fight her by entering the Echo of Hatred dungeon in the church of Nevesk. Defeating Echo of Lilith for the first time grants the player \"Silence is Hellish\" challenge, \"Lilith's\" title, Reins of the Bloody Liquid Steed, and two items of or above quality. Defeating the boss again grants no rewards except two items, which can be claimed once per character. Before you take on this boss, you need to make sure that your build is sufficiently strong. You should have at the very least 1 million DPS, otherwise the fight will take too long and the ever-growing, unavoidable damage from Blood Orb Creation will make it impossible. Lilith has 2 kinds of attacks: normal attacks and one-shot attacks. The former are no more dangerous than any regular level 100 boss; if your build can do Helltides and Dungeons, you will be just fine. The latter, however, will outright one-shot you and while some builds can get tanky enough to survive one such hit, for most it's a faraway dream. It's best to dodge these attacks and invest more into your damage. And this brings us to the most important stat you need for this encounter - Movement Speed. With base 100% Movement Speed, the wrong Boot implicit, and no mobility skills, many of Lilith's attacks become outright unavoidable. With a couple of Movement Speed rolls on your Boots and Amulet plus extra Evade charges, you can dodge everything she throws at you. Add in some mobility skills like and maybe an invulnerability button like and it becomes almost easy. Get at least 140% Movement Speed and either \"Max Evade Charges\" or \"Movement Speed after Evade\" roll on your boots. Similar to the Tormented Bosses of the Boss Ladder system, Lilith applies a stacking damage taken debuff to the player when hit by certain abilities. This allows a few mistakes throughout the fight before the incoming damage overwhelms you. These abilities are: It's advised to spec into a proper Bossing setup to complete the fight. Check out our to see the best builds! Lilith siphons the blood out of the player, dealing unavoidable damage and creating a Volatile Blood beneath their feet. At the same time, 3 Dancing Blood Orbs are created, which orbit the player's position for 5 seconds and then swiftly fly out of the arena. Getting hit by a Dancing Blood Orb deals minor damage and makes the player Vulnerable for 2.5 seconds.  This attack applies a stacking debuff to the player, which increases its damage by 2% per stack. The initial hit applies 2 stacks and each Dancing Blood Orb applies 1 stack on hit. is a common enemy with 1,200,000 HP. If not killed within 12 seconds, Volatile Blood erupts, dealing lethal damage in room-wide AoE. When Lilith is below 40% HP, this attack creates two Volatile Bloods. The initial hit is unavoidable its damage grows over time, so you need to have enough DPS to end the fight before you accumulate too many stacks of this debuff. Try to kill Volatile Blood as soon as possible. If you fail to do it in time, only abilities that make you can save you. Lilith takes 2 steps forward while striking the player twice with her wings. If the player is too far away, Lilith shadowsteps closer to them at the beginning of this attack. This attack can be easily outranged or side-stepped, but its damage is so low that most builds can just facetank it and use it as an opportunity to deal damage. Lilith creates a series of parallel fissures on the ground which explode after a 1 second delay, dealing damage to players standing on top of them. This version is used when Lilith is above 70% HP. Don't stand in the fire if you want to avoid the damage, but, similar to Melee Combo, this ability's damage is low enough for most builds to simply ignore it. Lilith creates two series of parallel fissures on the ground in a criss-cross pattern. Fissures explode after a 1 second delay, dealing damage to players standing on top of them. Standing on the intersection of two fissures deals damage twice. This version is used when Lilith is below 70% HP. The damage this ability stays the same but double-hit can be dangerous to more squishy builds, so don't stand on the intersection of two lines. Lilith turns to face the player and then summons two shadow clones of herself. After a brief delay, Lilith and her clones jump backwards while launching forward a wide wave of demonic spikes that deals lethal damage on contact. The easiest way to dodge this attack is to simply move behind Lilith while she is preparing the wave. If Lilith's back is to the edge of the arena and you can't stand behind her, you need to run backwards and to the side to get out of the way. In some cases the wave can be aimed directly through the arena's center, making it impossible to dodge without leaving the circle. To prevent this from happening, never stand between Lilith and the center of the arena when you both are close to the edge. Lilith leaps upward, briefly leaving the arena. After a 1.2 second delay, 3 warning markers are created on the ground: one directly next to the player and two more to the sides and slightly back. One second later, Lilith's shadow clones come crashing down and launch 3 narrow waves of demonic spikes from the position of the markers. Finally, Lilith herself comes down, launching the 4th wave down the middle lane from further back. This version is available at all times. As soon as you see Lilith crouch before her jump, start moving to the edge of the arena. If you get there fast enough, all the launching spots of the waves will be inside the circle. Then all you have to do is run to the opposite side until you get behind the 4th warning marker. This way you are never in a path of any waves and you are also right next to the Lilith's landing spot, ready to deal damage. If you fail to get to the edge of the arena in time, the safe areas may land outside the circle. In that case you have to dodge the attack the hard way. Move to the side of the first marker to let the wave pass you by. As soon as it passes, immediately get behind it to avoid the incoming side wave. Again, as soon as side wave passes, go behind it again to avoid the final wave coming down the middle. Keep in mind that the hitbox of the waves is slightly in front of them (which is further exacerbated by your latency), meaning that you will get hit before the wave even touches you. On the bright side, that also means that back side of the wave is quite safe: if you approach a wave from behind you can literally stand on top of the spikes without taking damage. Lilith leaps upward, briefly leaving the arena. After a 1.2 second delay, 3 warning markers are created on the ground: one directly next to the player and two more to the sides and far behind. One second later, Lilith's shadow clones come crashing down and launch 3 narrow waves of demonic spikes from the position of the markers. Finally Lilith herself comes down, launching the 4th wave down the middle lane from further back. This version is available when Lilith is below 70% HP. The exact same strategy can be used for this version: run to the edge, wait for marker, run to to opposite side to get behind the 4th wave. Since you always stay in the middle lane you don't have to worry about side waves no matter what direction they go. If you fail to get to the edge of the arena in time, you need to dodge differently. Get behind the first marker and then run behind the wave as closely as you can. When the side waves pass by, get out of the middle to avoid the incoming last wave. If the first marker is at the edge of the circle and you can't get behind it, simply run backwards and to the side to get behind one of the side waves. In this version, there are 3 waves going along the sides of a triangle in clockwise direction. Lilith herself comes down in the center of the triangle, dealing lethal damage in large circular AoE. This version is available when Lilith is below 40% HP. The general method of dodging remains the same: you need to get to one side of the circle so that the attack is aimed off-center, and then quickly dash to the safe area on the opposite site. Keep in mind that that the waves continue traveling past the vertices of the triangle so the to be safe you need to be completely outside it. Unlike the previous two versions, this attack leaves you with less time to react since you need to get out of the central AoE quickly. If you fail to get to the edge of the arena in time, there might be no safe zones at all and then only Invulnerability can save you. This version also has only 3 first waves from the second version. Instead of launching 4th wave down the middle, Lilith comes down directly next to the player, dealing lethal damage in large circular AoE. This version is available when Lilith is below 40% HP. The general method of dodging remains the same: you need to get to one side of the circle so that the attack is aimed off-center, and then quickly dash to the safe area on the opposite site. If you stay in the middle lane while doing that, don't forget about incoming wave that will come a few seconds later. Move left or right when the side waves pass you. If you fail to get to the edge of the arena in time, there might be no safe zones at all and then only Invulnerability can save you. Lilith plunges her tail into the ground while siphoning blood out of the player at the same time, dealing unavoidable damage and creating 8 Dancing Blood Orbs going around the player in two concentric circles. After a brief delay an explosion of blood goes off next to the player dealing damage and creating a new Blood Orb in the center. All previously created Blood Orbs caught in the explosion are destroyed. Dancing Blood Orbs deal minor damage and make the player Vulnerable for 2.5 seconds upon impact. After orbiting the player's original position for 5 seconds, Dancing Blood Orbs swiftly fly out of the arena. In this phase, Blood Orbs are not enemies but obstacles on the map. Stepping into a Blood Orb deals low damage over time to the player and slows them. During certain attacks in this phase, Blood Orbs create deadly Red Souls that chase down the player. If Lilith is Staggered, all Blood Orbs except two (selected at random) are destroyed. This attack applies a stacking debuff to the player, which increases its damage by 2% per stack. The initial hit and the blood explosion apply 2 stacks and each Dancing Blood Orb applies 1 stack on hit. The initial hit is unavoidable. Its damage grows over time, so you need to have enough DPS to end the fight before you accumulate too many stacks of the debuff. The explosion deals high damage but it's easy to dodge with Evade if you remember it's coming. This version of the attack does the same initial damage and creates Dancing Blood Orbs, but instead of creating a single blood explosion next to the player 4 explosions happen in different corners of the arena and 4 Blood Orbs are created. This version is used at the beginning of the second phase when there are no active Blood Orbs on the arena. It can be skipped completely if you manage to take Lilith below 85% health before she spawns them, making this entire phase significantly easier. Lilith strikes the player 1-3 times with her tail. Similar to first phase, the damage of this attack is so low that most builds can just facetank it and use it as an opportunity to deal damage. Lilith flies up into the air and pulls all enemies towards herself while slowing them for 3 seconds. At the same time, she summons 4-6 (depending on her HP) Children of Lilith.

Alternatively, you can use a mobility skill or 2-3 Evade charges to get out even while slowed. After dodging, kill the Children before continuing to fight Lilith. Lilith lets out a scream, knocking the player back. After that, Lilith dashes towards the player and shoots a three-pronged fork of shadows at the player, which deals heavy damage. Then she does this dash + fork combo a second time. At the same time, a shadow clone of Lilith is created nearby, which mimics her initial scream and two fork attacks with a 1 second delay. After all 4 forks are shot, Lilith slams the ground near player's position, releasing a massive shadow explosion that deals lethal damage. If Lilith is killed or Staggered during this attack, the shadow clone will continue acting on its own. Since Lilith's death animation is very long, you will receive no rewards for double KO. Very tanky builds can survive a single hit by a fork, but most have to dodge this attack entirely. To do that, move away from Lilith and run in a large circle. Each fork's middle prong is always aimed directly at you, so you will always dodge it as long as you move laterally. In doing so, you risk running into one of the side prongs, so you need to either be far enough away from Lilith or slow down a bit after you dodge the middle one.

    "content": "Stagger HP: 200 Echo of Lilith is an optional Boss in Diablo 4 accessible after unlocking Torment Difficulties by reaching level 60 and clearing the Pit level 20. Players can fight her by entering the Echo of Hatred dungeon in the church of Nevesk. Defeating Echo of Lilith for the first time grants the player \"Silence is Hellish\" challenge, \"Lilith's\" title, Reins of the Bloody Liquid Steed, and two items of or above quality. Defeating the boss again grants no rewards except two items, which can be claimed once per character. Before you take on this boss, you need to make sure that your build is sufficiently strong. You should have at the very least 1 million DPS, otherwise the fight will take too long and the ever-growing, unavoidable damage from Blood Orb Creation will make it impossible. Lilith has 2 kinds of attacks: normal attacks and one-shot attacks. The former are no more dangerous than any regular level 100 boss; if your build can do Helltides and Dungeons, you will be just fine. The latter, however, will outright one-shot you and while some builds can get tanky enough to survive one such hit, for most it's a faraway dream. It's best to dodge these attacks and invest more into your damage. And this brings us to the most important stat you need for this encounter - Movement Speed. With base 100% Movement Speed, the wrong Boot implicit, and no mobility skills, many of Lilith's attacks become outright unavoidable. With a couple of Movement Speed rolls on your Boots and Amulet plus extra Evade charges, you can dodge everything she throws at you. Add in some mobility skills like and maybe an invulnerability button like and it becomes almost easy. Get at least 140% Movement Speed and either \"Max Evade Charges\" or \"Movement Speed after Evade\" roll on your boots. Similar to the Tormented Bosses of the Boss Ladder system, Lilith applies a stacking damage taken debuff to the player when hit by certain abilities. This allows a few mistakes throughout the fight before the incoming damage overwhelms you. These abilities are: It's advised to spec into a proper Bossing setup to complete the fight. Check out our to see the best builds! Lilith siphons the blood out of the player, dealing unavoidable damage and creating a Volatile Blood beneath their feet. At the same time, 3 Dancing Blood Orbs are created, which orbit the player's position for 5 seconds and then swiftly fly out of the arena. Getting hit by a Dancing Blood Orb deals minor damage and makes the player Vulnerable for 2.5 seconds.  This attack applies a stacking debuff to the player, which increases its damage by 2% per stack. The initial hit applies 2 stacks and each Dancing Blood Orb applies 1 stack on hit. is a common enemy with 1,200,000 HP. If not killed within 12 seconds, Volatile Blood erupts, dealing lethal damage in room-wide AoE. When Lilith is below 40% HP, this attack creates two Volatile Bloods. The initial hit is unavoidable its damage grows over time, so you need to have enough DPS to end the fight before you accumulate too many stacks of this debuff. Try to kill Volatile Blood as soon as possible. If you fail to do it in time, only abilities that make you can save you. Lilith takes 2 steps forward while striking the player twice with her wings. If the player is too far away, Lilith shadowsteps closer to them at the beginning of this attack. This attack can be easily outranged or side-stepped, but its damage is so low that most builds can just facetank it and use it as an opportunity to deal damage. Lilith creates a series of parallel fissures on the ground which explode after a 1 second delay, dealing damage to players standing on top of them. This version is used when Lilith is above 70% HP. Don't stand in the fire if you want to avoid the damage, but, similar to Melee Combo, this ability's damage is low enough for most builds to simply ignore it. Lilith creates two series of parallel fissures on the ground in a criss-cross pattern. Fissures explode after a 1 second delay, dealing damage to players standing on top of them. Standing on the intersection of two fissures deals damage twice. This version is used when Lilith is below 70% HP. The damage this ability stays the same but double-hit can be dangerous to more squishy builds, so don't stand on the intersection of two lines. Lilith turns to face the player and then summons two shadow clones of herself. After a brief delay, Lilith and her clones jump backwards while launching forward a wide wave of demonic spikes that deals lethal damage on contact. The easiest way to dodge this attack is to simply move behind Lilith while she is preparing the wave. If Lilith's back is to the edge of the arena and you can't stand behind her, you need to run backwards and to the side to get out of the way. In some cases the wave can be aimed directly through the arena's center, making it impossible to dodge without leaving the circle. To prevent this from happening, never stand between Lilith and the center of the arena when you both are close to the edge. Lilith leaps upward, briefly leaving the arena. After a 1.2 second delay, 3 warning markers are created on the ground: one directly next to the player and two more to the sides and slightly back. One second later, Lilith's shadow clones come crashing down and launch 3 narrow waves of demonic spikes from the position of the markers. Finally, Lilith herself comes down, launching the 4th wave down the middle lane from further back. This version is available at all times. As soon as you see Lilith crouch before her jump, start moving to the edge of the arena. If you get there fast enough, all the launching spots of the waves will be inside the circle. Then all you have to do is run to the opposite side until you get behind the 4th warning marker. This way you are never in a path of any waves and you are also right next to the Lilith's landing spot, ready to deal damage. If you fail to get to the edge of the arena in time, the safe areas may land outside the circle. In that case you have to dodge the attack the hard way. Move to the side of the first marker to let the wave pass you by. As soon as it passes, immediately get behind it to avoid the incoming side wave. Again, as soon as side wave passes, go behind it again to avoid the final wave coming down the middle. Keep in mind that the hitbox of the waves is slightly in front of them (which is further exacerbated by your latency), meaning that you will get hit before the wave even touches you. On the bright side, that also means that back side of the wave is quite safe: if you approach a wave from behind you can literally stand on top of the spikes without taking damage. Lilith leaps upward, briefly leaving the arena. After a 1.2 second delay, 3 warning markers are created on the ground: one directly next to the player and two more to the sides and far behind. One second later, Lilith's shadow clones come crashing down and launch 3 narrow waves of demonic spikes from the position of the markers. Finally Lilith herself comes down, launching the 4th wave down the middle lane from further back. This version is available when Lilith is below 70% HP. The exact same strategy can be used for this version: run to the edge, wait for marker, run to to opposite side to get behind the 4th wave. Since you always stay in the middle lane you don't have to worry about side waves no matter what direction they go. If you fail to get to the edge of the arena in time, you need to dodge differently. Get behind the first marker and then run behind the wave as closely as you can. When the side waves pass by, get out of the middle to avoid the incoming last wave. If the first marker is at the edge of the circle and you can't get behind it, simply run backwards and to the side to get behind one of the side waves. In this version, there are 3 waves going along the sides of a triangle in clockwise direction. Lilith herself comes down in the center of the triangle, dealing lethal damage in large circular AoE. This version is available when Lilith is below 40% HP. The general method of dodging remains the same: you need to get to one side of the circle so that the attack is aimed off-center, and then quickly dash to the safe area on the opposite site. Keep in mind that that the waves continue traveling past the vertices of the triangle so the to be safe you need to be completely outside it. Unlike the previous two versions, this attack leaves you with less time to react since you need to get out of the central AoE quickly. If you fail to get to the edge of the arena in time, there might be no safe zones at all and then only Invulnerability can save you. This version also has only 3 first waves from the second version. Instead of launching 4th wave down the middle, Lilith comes down directly next to the player, dealing lethal damage in large circular AoE. This version is available when Lilith is below 40% HP. The general method of dodging remains the same: you need to get to one side of the circle so that the attack is aimed off-center, and then quickly dash to the safe area on the opposite site. If you stay in the middle lane while doing that, don't forget about incoming wave that will come a few seconds later. Move left or right when the side waves pass you. If you fail to get to the edge of the arena in time, there might be no safe zones at all and then only Invulnerability can save you. Lilith plunges her tail into the ground while siphoning blood out of the player at the same time, dealing unavoidable damage and creating 8 Dancing Blood Orbs going around the player in two concentric circles. After a brief delay an explosion of blood goes off next to the player dealing damage and creating a new Blood Orb in the center. All previously created Blood Orbs caught in the explosion are destroyed. Dancing Blood Orbs deal minor damage and make the player Vulnerable for 2.5 seconds upon impact. After orbiting the player's original position for 5 seconds, Dancing Blood Orbs swiftly fly out of the arena. In this phase, Blood Orbs are not enemies but obstacles on the map. Stepping into a Blood Orb deals low damage over time to the player and slows them. During certain attacks in this phase, Blood Orbs create deadly Red Souls that chase down the player. If Lilith is Staggered, all Blood Orbs except two (selected at random) are destroyed. This attack applies a stacking debuff to the player, which increases its damage by 2% per stack. The initial hit and the blood explosion apply 2 stacks and each Dancing Blood Orb applies 1 stack on hit. The initial hit is unavoidable. Its damage grows over time, so you need to have enough DPS to end the fight before you accumulate too many stacks of the debuff. The explosion deals high damage but it's easy to dodge with Evade if you remember it's coming. This version of the attack does the same initial damage and creates Dancing Blood Orbs, but instead of creating a single blood explosion next to the player 4 explosions happen in different corners of the arena and 4 Blood Orbs are created. This version is used at the beginning of the second phase when there are no active Blood Orbs on the arena. It can be skipped completely if you manage to take Lilith below 85% health before she spawns them, making this entire phase significantly easier. Lilith strikes the player 1-3 times with her tail. Similar to first phase, the damage of this attack is so low that most builds can just facetank it and use it as an opportunity to deal damage. Lilith flies up into the air and pulls all enemies towards herself while slowing them for 3 seconds. At the same time, she summons 4-6 (depending on her HP) Children of Lilith. After a 2 second delay, Lilith slams down onto the ground, dealing lethal damage in a large circle. Children of Lilith are a ghoul type enemies who pose no threat on their own but can become a source of Souls during certain attacks. If you get hit by the pull + slow you won't be able to get out of the AoE by just running. You need to use an ability to prevent the pull or to remove the slow. Alternatively, you can use a mobility skill or 2-3 Evade charges to get out even while slowed. After dodging, kill the Children before continuing to fight Lilith. Lilith lets out a scream, knocking the player back. After that, Lilith dashes towards the player and shoots a three-pronged fork of shadows at the player, which deals heavy damage. Then she does this dash + fork combo a second time. At the same time, a shadow clone of Lilith is created nearby, which mimics her initial scream and two fork attacks with a 1 second delay. After all 4 forks are shot, Lilith slams the ground near player's position, releasing a massive shadow explosion that deals lethal damage. If Lilith is killed or Staggered during this attack, the shadow clone will continue acting on its own. Since Lilith's death animation is very long, you will receive no rewards for double KO. Very tanky builds can survive a single hit by a fork, but most have to dodge this attack entirely. To do that, move away from Lilith and run in a large circle. Each fork's middle prong is always aimed directly at you, so you will always dodge it as long as you move laterally. In doing so, you risk running into one of the side prongs, so you need to either be far enough away from Lilith or slow down a bit after you dodge the middle one. When Lilith raises her wings before the final part of the attack, move quickly to the opposite side of the arena to avoid the explosion. Lilith flies up and leaves the arena. After a brief delay, she comes back flying across the entire battlefield, covering the ground behind her in a thick layer of cursed blood. After a 3 second delay, the blood ignites, dealing lethal damage to all enemies caught in it for the next 2 seconds. There's always a safe zone at the side of the arena where Lilith finishes her flight. This attack is trivial to dodge on it's own and only becomes dangerous when combined with Souls chasing down the player. Remember that no damage is done until the blood catches fire, so you don't need to rush into the safe zone immediately. After player enters the arena, Lilith will drop down in the center, knocking the player back and creating a Circle of Doom that limits the size of the playable area. Stepping outside of the circle will deal extremely high damage over time to the player. The fight always starts with the fixed sequence of attacks: After that she will select one of 5 attacks available to her: Lilith will always prioritize Blood Orb Creation if it's not on cooldown. She will never do Melee Combo more than twice in a row. Otherwise the attacks are selected at random. During this stage of the fight, Lilith has long cooldowns on her high-damage attacks, giving you plenty of time to damage her and/or apply Stagger. Be ready to dodge Wave of Spikes or Death From Above when they come and you should be able to get through this stage without much trouble. When Lilith's health goes below 70%, she will finish her attack and summon 2 Enforcers. After that, she will continuously use Death From Above as long as at least one of the Enforcers is alive (but no less than 2 times). Each Enforcer will leave behind 2 Volatile Bloods and  6 Health Potion charges upon death. Enforcers themselves deal almost no damage. Your primary focus should be on dodging the Death From Above spam while killing them. Stay at the edge of the arena and let the Enforcers come to you. Be mindful of their pull attack as it can move you into the one-shot attacks from Lilith. If your build is not great at cleaning up Volatile Blood, try to kill the minions one-by-one and kill the Blood in-between. After you kill both minions, the camera returns to the normal zoom level and the second stage of the fight begins. Lilith's abilities are upgraded: Her attacks, in general, will follow this pattern: Your best strategy is to focus on dodging during steps 1-3 and doing damage during step 4. Since her Blood Orb Creation now has reduced cooldown and still has highest priority, the attack in step 2 will often be Blood Orb Creation. It's recommended to focus on dodging the incoming Death From Above first and killing Volatile Bloods second. Since Volatile Bloods take 12 seconds to detonate, you have plenty of time to kill it without the threat of a one-shot hanging over you. When Lilith's health goes below 40%, she will finish her attack and summon 3 Oppressors. Same as the first minion phase, she will spam use Death From Above as long as her minions live. This phase is not very different from the first one. Now there are 3 minions instead of 2 but they pose little threat and all the danger is coming from now further upgraded Death From Above. Our strategy stays the same: focus on dodging first and killing second. After the minions die, the fight continues with more improvements to Lilith's attacks: During this stage Lilith will simply use Death From Above after every 2-3 attacks giving you little time to deal damage. Stay at the edge of the arena at all times to make dodging easier and slowly work through her HP bar. When Lilith's HP hits 0, the circle created at the start of the fight will disappear and 20 seconds later Echo of Lilith, Mother of Mankind will spawn in the center. Lilith opens up the fight with a semi-fixed sequence of attacks: After that she behaves similar to her first phase. She casts Blood Orb Creation whenever its 15s cooldown is ready and otherwise randomly chooses between Melee Combo, Flight (~20s cooldown), and Shadow Clone (~20s cooldown). During this part of the fight, the only threatening attack Lilith has is Shadow Clone, but with plenty of space to dodge it, you can always run in a big circle and be completely fine. Instead, you should focus at dealing damage and managing Blood Orbs. When the Blood Orb Creation is coming up, move next to (or even inside of) one of the existing Blood Orbs to make sure that their numbers don't increase. Staggering Lilith at this stage is also beneficial as it will destroy some of the Blood Orbs. Alternatively, you can just run to the top of the arena to spawn new Blood Orbs, as this section of the arena will soon be destroyed. This, however, makes the next phase transition very hard to survive, so only do this if you have an Invulnerability skill to help you. After Lilith's HP falls below 85% she will finish her current attack and use Flight (bottom to top). After that, she performs a special move (Lilith can't be Staggered during this time) where she uses her wings to destroy part of the arena. This section overlaps with the safe zone of previously used Flight and players standing on it take minor damage over time. 6 seconds later, the cut-off section crumbles down into the abyss, instantly killing all players standing on it. While the platform is crumbling and for 2 second after, Blood Orbs shoot Souls at the player. 2 Souls are created each second, regardless of the number of currently active Blood Orbs. Souls move at ~133% Movement Speed and home in on their target, but their turn speed is very low, making it possible to sidestep them. Souls deal heavy damage on contact. After the platform is broken, Lilith teleports to the center of arena and uses Ground Slam. Dodging all these attacks can be tricky but it becomes much easier if you can outrun the Souls. Then you just have to run in a large circle, timing it in such a way that you enter the crumbling platform right before the blood on the floor starts burning, and then leave it before it falls down, all without stopping. In this case, you only have to worry about the Souls coming straight at you and you Evade or simply take a step to the side to dodge them. Be aware that the pull from the Ground Slam attack will happen while there's still some Souls out, so you need to make sure that there are no Souls between you and arena's center when it happens (or simply use Unstoppable ability to prevent the pull). The second stage of the fight is no different from the first one, but now Lilith has one more ability to choose from: Ground Slam. The next stage begins when Lilith HP falls below 60% mark. Lilith will once again open up with Flight (bottom left to top right) and then will start breaking off the corner of the platform. Unlike the first time, the safe zone of Flight doesn't perfectly overlap with the crumbling platform and there's some burning blood in the left corner of it. There's nothing different in the way you dodge this attack but it's a bit more difficult because the safe zone and the arena itself is now smaller. After the platform is broken, Lilith will teleport to the center and use Ground Slam. During this stage of the fight, Lilith doesn't gain any new abilities but she gets some upgrades: When Lilith falls below 30% HP, she will break the last corner of the platform, starting with Flight (bottom right to top left), then platform break with all the bells whistles and Souls. As she destroys the last platform, she will cast Shadow Clone. After this, the fight continues but Lilith now has no cooldown on her Flight ability and will often use it twice in a row in opposite directions, forcing you to run from one end of the arena to the other and stand in a tiny safe zone while dodging all the Souls coming for you. On top of that, the arena itself is so small now that you barely have space to dodge her Ground Slam and Shadow Clone attacks. Needless to say, staying alive and dealing damage is extremely difficult so it's recommended to Stagger Lilith either right before or right after the last transition and then deal as much damage as possible to shorten this stage of the fight or even outright kill her. The above description of the fight tells you what happens if you slowly and steadily deal damage to Lilith and she has plenty of time to perform all her special attacks. Things can be very different if your damage is overwhelmingly high and certain parts of the fight can be outright skipped. For example, if you deal 60% of Lilith's HP in one hit at the beginning of the fight, she will go up and then come down to summon Oppressors, and you will never have to fight any Enforcers. Now, most builds can't do that kind of damage but that's where Stagger comes in. Staggering Lilith lets you deal damage to her for 5 seconds uninterrupted and many builds can deal serious damage during that timeframe. If you Stagger her before she gets below 70% HP and then kill her before Stagger ends, you skip the most difficult parts of the first phase. If you manage to build stagger fast enough to Stagger her during the opening sequence of attacks, then you can finish the fight without dodging once. Depending on your damage output you can aim to stagger her at different HP thresholds: To manipulate the moment when Stagger happens you need to adjust the amount of stagger damage your build deals. There's two ways to do that: If you lack the damage to skip parts of the fight within one stagger, you can swap your gear during the fight. For example, you can use to build up Stagger and then switch to offensive gloves and during the Stagger. Reviewed by"

Children of Lilith are a ghoul type enemies who pose no threat on their own but can become a source of Souls during certain attacks. If you get hit by the pull + slow you won't be able to get out of the AoE by just running. You need to use an ability to prevent the pull or to remove the slow. Alternatively, you can use a mobility skill or 2-3 Evade charges to get out even while slowed. After dodging, kill the Children before continuing to fight Lilith. Lilith lets out a scream, knocking the player back. After that, Lilith dashes towards the player and shoots a three-pronged fork of shadows at the player, which deals heavy damage. Then she does this dash + fork combo a second time. At the same time, a shadow clone of Lilith is created nearby, which mimics her initial scream and two fork attacks with a 1 second delay. After all 4 forks are shot, Lilith slams the ground near player's position, releasing a massive shadow explosion that deals lethal damage. If Lilith is killed or Staggered during this attack, the shadow clone will continue acting on its own. Since Lilith's death animation is very long, you will receive no rewards for double KO. Very tanky builds can survive a single hit by a fork, but most have to dodge this attack entirely. To do that, move away from Lilith and run in a large circle. Each fork's middle prong is always aimed directly at you, so you will always dodge it as long as you move laterally. In doing so, you risk running into one of the side prongs, so you need to either be far enough away from Lilith or slow down a bit after you dodge the middle one. When Lilith raises her wings before the final part of the attack, move quickly to the opposite side of the arena to avoid the explosion. Lilith flies up and leaves the arena. After a brief delay, she comes back flying across the entire battlefield, covering the ground behind her in a thick layer of cursed blood. After a 3 second delay, the blood ignites, dealing lethal damage to all enemies caught in it for the next 2 seconds. There's always a safe zone at the side of the arena where Lilith finishes her flight. This attack is trivial to dodge on it's own and only becomes dangerous when combined with Souls chasing down the player. Remember that no damage is done until the blood catches fire, so you don't need to rush into the safe zone immediately. After player enters the arena, Lilith will drop down in the center, knocking the player back and creating a Circle of Doom that limits the size of the playable area. Stepping outside of the circle will deal extremely high damage over time to the player. The fight always starts with the fixed sequence of attacks: After that she will select one of 5 attacks available to her: Lilith will always prioritize Blood Orb Creation if it's not on cooldown. She will never do Melee Combo more than twice in a row. Otherwise the attacks are selected at random. During this stage of the fight, Lilith has long cooldowns on her high-damage attacks, giving you plenty of time to damage her and/or apply Stagger. Be ready to dodge Wave of Spikes or Death From Above when they come and you should be able to get through this stage without much trouble. When Lilith's health goes below 70%, she will finish her attack and summon 2 Enforcers. After that, she will continuously use Death From Above as long as at least one of the Enforcers is alive (but no less than 2 times). Each Enforcer will leave behind 2 Volatile Bloods and  6 Health Potion charges upon death. Enforcers themselves deal almost no damage. Your primary focus should be on dodging the Death From Above spam while killing them. Stay at the edge of the arena and let the Enforcers come to you. Be mindful of their pull attack as it can move you into the one-shot attacks from Lilith. If your build is not great at cleaning up Volatile Blood, try to kill the minions one-by-one and kill the Blood in-between. After you kill both minions, the camera returns to the normal zoom level and the second stage of the fight begins. Lilith's abilities are upgraded: Her attacks, in general, will follow this pattern: Your best strategy is to focus on dodging during steps 1-3 and doing damage during step 4. Since her Blood Orb Creation now has reduced cooldown and still has highest priority, the attack in step 2 will often be Blood Orb Creation. It's recommended to focus on dodging the incoming Death From Above first and killing Volatile Bloods second. Since Volatile Bloods take 12 seconds to detonate, you have plenty of time to kill it without the threat of a one-shot hanging over you. When Lilith's health goes below 40%, she will finish her attack and summon 3 Oppressors. Same as the first minion phase, she will spam use Death From Above as long as her minions live. This phase is not very different from the first one. Now there are 3 minions instead of 2 but they pose little threat and all the danger is coming from now further upgraded Death From Above. Our strategy stays the same: focus on dodging first and killing second. After the minions die, the fight continues with more improvements to Lilith's attacks: During this stage Lilith will simply use Death From Above after every 2-3 attacks giving you little time to deal damage. Stay at the edge of the arena at all times to make dodging easier and slowly work through her HP bar. When Lilith's HP hits 0, the circle created at the start of the fight will disappear and 20 seconds later Echo of Lilith, Mother of Mankind will spawn in the center. Lilith opens up the fight with a semi-fixed sequence of attacks: After that she behaves similar to her first phase. She casts Blood Orb Creation whenever its 15s cooldown is ready and otherwise randomly chooses between Melee Combo, Flight (~20s cooldown), and Shadow Clone (~20s cooldown). During this part of the fight, the only threatening attack Lilith has is Shadow Clone, but with plenty of space to dodge it, you can always run in a big circle and be completely fine. Instead, you should focus at dealing damage and managing Blood Orbs. When the Blood Orb Creation is coming up, move next to (or even inside of) one of the existing Blood Orbs to make sure that their numbers don't increase. Staggering Lilith at this stage is also beneficial as it will destroy some of the Blood Orbs. Alternatively, you can just run to the top of the arena to spawn new Blood Orbs, as this section of the arena will soon be destroyed. This, however, makes the next phase transition very hard to survive, so only do this if you have an Invulnerability skill to help you. After Lilith's HP falls below 85% she will finish her current attack and use Flight (bottom to top). After that, she performs a special move (Lilith can't be Staggered during this time) where she uses her wings to destroy part of the arena. This section overlaps with the safe zone of previously used Flight and players standing on it take minor damage over time. 6 seconds later, the cut-off section crumbles down into the abyss, instantly killing all players standing on it. While the platform is crumbling and for 2 second after, Blood Orbs shoot Souls at the player. 2 Souls are created each second, regardless of the number of currently active Blood Orbs. Souls move at ~133% Movement Speed and home in on their target, but their turn speed is very low, making it possible to sidestep them. Souls deal heavy damage on contact. After the platform is broken, Lilith teleports to the center of arena and uses Ground Slam. Dodging all these attacks can be tricky but it becomes much easier if you can outrun the Souls. Then you just have to run in a large circle, timing it in such a way that you enter the crumbling platform right before the blood on the floor starts burning, and then leave it before it falls down, all without stopping. In this case, you only have to worry about the Souls coming straight at you and you Evade or simply take a step to the side to dodge them. Be aware that the pull from the Ground Slam attack will happen while there's still some Souls out, so you need to make sure that there are no Souls between you and arena's center when it happens (or simply use Unstoppable ability to prevent the pull). The second stage of the fight is no different from the first one, but now Lilith has one more ability to choose from: Ground Slam. The next stage begins when Lilith HP falls below 60% mark. Lilith will once again open up with Flight (bottom left to top right) and then will start breaking off the corner of the platform. Unlike the first time, the safe zone of Flight doesn't perfectly overlap with the crumbling platform and there's some burning blood in the left corner of it. There's nothing different in the way you dodge this attack but it's a bit more difficult because the safe zone and the arena itself is now smaller. After the platform is broken, Lilith will teleport to the center and use Ground Slam. During this stage of the fight, Lilith doesn't gain any new abilities but she gets some upgrades: When Lilith falls below 30% HP, she will break the last corner of the platform, starting with Flight (bottom right to top left), then platform break with all the bells whistles and Souls. As she destroys the last platform, she will cast Shadow Clone. After this, the fight continues but Lilith now has no cooldown on her Flight ability and will often use it twice in a row in opposite directions, forcing you to run from one end of the arena to the other and stand in a tiny safe zone while dodging all the Souls coming for you. On top of that, the arena itself is so small now that you barely have space to dodge her Ground Slam and Shadow Clone attacks. Needless to say, staying alive and dealing damage is extremely difficult so it's recommended to Stagger Lilith either right before or right after the last transition and then deal as much damage as possible to shorten this stage of the fight or even outright kill her. The above description of the fight tells you what happens if you slowly and steadily deal damage to Lilith and she has plenty of time to perform all her special attacks. Things can be very different if your damage is overwhelmingly high and certain parts of the fight can be outright skipped. For example, if you deal 60% of Lilith's HP in one hit at the beginning of the fight, she will go up and then come down to summon Oppressors, and you will never have to fight any Enforcers. Now, most builds can't do that kind of damage but that's where Stagger comes in. Staggering Lilith lets you deal damage to her for 5 seconds uninterrupted and many builds can deal serious damage during that timeframe. If you Stagger her before she gets below 70% HP and then kill her before Stagger ends, you skip the most difficult parts of the first phase. If you manage to build stagger fast enough to Stagger her during the opening sequence of attacks, then you can finish the fight without dodging once. Depending on your damage output you can aim to stagger her at different HP thresholds: To manipulate the moment when Stagger happens you need to adjust the amount of stagger damage your build deals. There's two ways to do that: If you lack the damage to skip parts of the fight within one stagger, you can swap your gear during the fight. For example, you can use to build up Stagger and then switch to offensive gloves and during the Stagger. Reviewed by"

Before you take on this boss, you need to make sure that your build is sufficiently strong. You should have at the very least 1 million DPS, otherwise the fight will take too long and the ever-growing, unavoidable damage from Blood Orb Creation will make it impossible. Lilith has 2 kinds of attacks: normal attacks and one-shot attacks. The former are no more dangerous than any regular level 100 boss; if your build can do Helltides and Dungeons, you will be just fine. The latter, however, will outright one-shot you and while some builds can get tanky enough to survive one such hit, for most it's a faraway dream. It's best to dodge these attacks and invest more into your damage. And this brings us to the most important stat you need for this encounter - Movement Speed. With base 100% Movement Speed, the wrong Boot implicit, and no mobility skills, many of Lilith's attacks become outright unavoidable. With a couple of Movement Speed rolls on your Boots and Amulet plus extra Evade charges, you can dodge everything she throws at you. Add in some mobility skills like and maybe an invulnerability button like and it becomes almost easy. Get at least 140% Movement Speed and either \"Max Evade Charges\" or \"Movement Speed after Evade\" roll on your boots. Similar to the Tormented Bosses of the Boss Ladder system, Lilith applies a stacking damage taken debuff to the player when hit by certain abilities. This allows a few mistakes throughout the fight before the incoming damage overwhelms you. These abilities are: It's advised to spec into a proper Bossing setup to complete the fight. Check out our to see the best builds! Lilith siphons the blood out of the player, dealing unavoidable damage and creating a Volatile Blood beneath their feet. At the same time, 3 Dancing Blood Orbs are created, which orbit the player's position for 5 seconds and then swiftly fly out of the arena. Getting hit by a Dancing Blood Orb deals minor damage and makes the player Vulnerable for 2.5 seconds.  This attack applies a stacking debuff to the player, which increases its damage by 2% per stack. The initial hit applies 2 stacks and each Dancing Blood Orb applies 1 stack on hit. is a common enemy with 1,200,000 HP. If not killed within 12 seconds, Volatile Blood erupts, dealing lethal damage in room-wide AoE. When Lilith is below 40% HP, this attack creates two Volatile Bloods. The initial hit is unavoidable its damage grows over time, so you need to have enough DPS to end the fight before you accumulate too many stacks of this debuff. Try to kill Volatile Blood as soon as possible. If you fail to do it in time, only abilities that make you can save you. Lilith takes 2 steps forward while striking the player twice with her wings. If the player is too far away, Lilith shadowsteps closer to them at the beginning of this attack. This attack can be easily outranged or side-stepped, but its damage is so low that most builds can just facetank it and use it as an opportunity to deal damage. Lilith creates a series of parallel fissures on the ground which explode after a 1 second delay, dealing damage to players standing on top of them. This version is used when Lilith is above 70% HP. Don't stand in the fire if you want to avoid the damage, but, similar to Melee Combo, this ability's damage is low enough for most builds to simply ignore it. Lilith creates two series of parallel fissures on the ground in a criss-cross pattern. Fissures explode after a 1 second delay, dealing damage to players standing on top of them. Standing on the intersection of two fissures deals damage twice. This version is used when Lilith is below 70% HP. The damage this ability stays the same but double-hit can be dangerous to more squishy builds, so don't stand on the intersection of two lines. Lilith turns to face the player and then summons two shadow clones of herself. After a brief delay, Lilith and her clones jump backwards while launching forward a wide wave of demonic spikes that deals lethal damage on contact. The easiest way to dodge this attack is to simply move behind Lilith while she is preparing the wave. If Lilith's back is to the edge of the arena and you can't stand behind her, you need to run backwards and to the side to get out of the way. In some cases the wave can be aimed directly through the arena's center, making it impossible to dodge without leaving the circle. To prevent this from happening, never stand between Lilith and the center of the arena when you both are close to the edge. Lilith leaps upward, briefly leaving the arena. After a 1.2 second delay, 3 warning markers are created on the ground: one directly next to the player and two more to the sides and slightly back. One second later, Lilith's shadow clones come crashing down and launch 3 narrow waves of demonic spikes from the position of the markers. Finally, Lilith herself comes down, launching the 4th wave down the middle lane from further back. This version is available at all times. As soon as you see Lilith crouch before her jump, start moving to the edge of the arena. If you get there fast enough, all the launching spots of the waves will be inside the circle. Then all you have to do is run to the opposite side until you get behind the 4th warning marker. This way you are never in a path of any waves and you are also right next to the Lilith's landing spot, ready to deal damage. If you fail to get to the edge of the arena in time, the safe areas may land outside the circle. In that case you have to dodge the attack the hard way. Move to the side of the first marker to let the wave pass you by. As soon as it passes, immediately get behind it to avoid the incoming side wave. Again, as soon as side wave passes, go behind it again to avoid the final wave coming down the middle. Keep in mind that the hitbox of the waves is slightly in front of them (which is further exacerbated by your latency), meaning that you will get hit before the wave even touches you. On the bright side, that also means that back side of the wave is quite safe: if you approach a wave from behind you can literally stand on top of the spikes without taking damage. Lilith leaps upward, briefly leaving the arena. After a 1.2 second delay, 3 warning markers are created on the ground: one directly next to the player and two more to the sides and far behind. One second later, Lilith's shadow clones come crashing down and launch 3 narrow waves of demonic spikes from the position of the markers. Finally Lilith herself comes down, launching the 4th wave down the middle lane from further back. This version is available when Lilith is below 70% HP. The exact same strategy can be used for this version: run to the edge, wait for marker, run to to opposite side to get behind the 4th wave. Since you always stay in the middle lane you don't have to worry about side waves no matter what direction they go. If you fail to get to the edge of the arena in time, you need to dodge differently. Get behind the first marker and then run behind the wave as closely as you can. When the side waves pass by, get out of the middle to avoid the incoming last wave. If the first marker is at the edge of the circle and you can't get behind it, simply run backwards and to the side to get behind one of the side waves. In this version, there are 3 waves going along the sides of a triangle in clockwise direction. Lilith herself comes down in the center of the triangle, dealing lethal damage in large circular AoE. This version is available when Lilith is below 40% HP. The general method of dodging remains the same: you need to get to one side of the circle so that the attack is aimed off-center, and then quickly dash to the safe area on the opposite site. Keep in mind that that the waves continue traveling past the vertices of the triangle so the to be safe you need to be completely outside it. Unlike the previous two versions, this attack leaves you with less time to react since you need to get out of the central AoE quickly. If you fail to get to the edge of the arena in time, there might be no safe zones at all and then only Invulnerability can save you. This version also has only 3 first waves from the second version. Instead of launching 4th wave down the middle, Lilith comes down directly next to the player, dealing lethal damage in large circular AoE. This version is available when Lilith is below 40% HP. The general method of dodging remains the same: you need to get to one side of the circle so that the attack is aimed off-center, and then quickly dash to the safe area on the opposite site. If you stay in the middle lane while doing that, don't forget about incoming wave that will come a few seconds later. Move left or right when the side waves pass you. If you fail to get to the edge of the arena in time, there might be no safe zones at all and then only Invulnerability can save you. Lilith plunges her tail into the ground while siphoning blood out of the player at the same time, dealing unavoidable damage and creating 8 Dancing Blood Orbs going around the player in two concentric circles. After a brief delay an explosion of blood goes off next to the player dealing damage and creating a new Blood Orb in the center. All previously created Blood Orbs caught in the explosion are destroyed. Dancing Blood Orbs deal minor damage and make the player Vulnerable for 2.5 seconds upon impact. After orbiting the player's original position for 5 seconds, Dancing Blood Orbs swiftly fly out of the arena. In this phase, Blood Orbs are not enemies but obstacles on the map. Stepping into a Blood Orb deals low damage over time to the player and slows them. During certain attacks in this phase, Blood Orbs create deadly Red Souls that chase down the player. If Lilith is Staggered, all Blood Orbs except two (selected at random) are destroyed. This attack applies a stacking debuff to the player, which increases its damage by 2% per stack. The initial hit and the blood explosion apply 2 stacks and each Dancing Blood Orb applies 1 stack on hit. The initial hit is unavoidable. Its damage grows over time, so you need to have enough DPS to end the fight before you accumulate too many stacks of the debuff. The explosion deals high damage but it's easy to dodge with Evade if you remember it's coming. This version of the attack does the same initial damage and creates Dancing Blood Orbs, but instead of creating a single blood explosion next to the player 4 explosions happen in different corners of the arena and 4 Blood Orbs are created. This version is used at the beginning of the second phase when there are no active Blood Orbs on the arena. It can be skipped completely if you manage to take Lilith below 85% health before she spawns them, making this entire phase significantly easier. Lilith strikes the player 1-3 times with her tail. Similar to first phase, the damage of this attack is so low that most builds can just facetank it and use it as an opportunity to deal damage. Lilith flies up into the air and pulls all enemies towards herself while slowing them for 3 seconds. At the same time, she summons 4-6 (depending on her HP) Children of Lilith. After a 2 second delay, Lilith slams down onto the ground, dealing lethal damage in a large circle. Children of Lilith are a ghoul type enemies who pose no threat on their own but can become a source of Souls during certain attacks. If you get hit by the pull + slow you won't be able to get out of the AoE by just running. You need to use an ability to prevent the pull or to remove the slow. Alternatively, you can use a mobility skill or 2-3 Evade charges to get out even while slowed. After dodging, kill the Children before continuing to fight Lilith. Lilith lets out a scream, knocking the player back. After that, Lilith dashes towards the player and shoots a three-pronged fork of shadows at the player, which deals heavy damage. Then she does this dash + fork combo a second time. At the same time, a shadow clone of Lilith is created nearby, which mimics her initial scream and two fork attacks with a 1 second delay. After all 4 forks are shot, Lilith slams the ground near player's position, releasing a massive shadow explosion that deals lethal damage. If Lilith is killed or Staggered during this attack, the shadow clone will continue acting on its own. Since Lilith's death animation is very long, you will receive no rewards for double KO. Very tanky builds can survive a single hit by a fork, but most have to dodge this attack entirely. To do that, move away from Lilith and run in a large circle. Each fork's middle prong is always aimed directly at you, so you will always dodge it as long as you move laterally. In doing so, you risk running into one of the side prongs, so you need to either be far enough away from Lilith or slow down a bit after you dodge the middle one. When Lilith raises her wings before the final part of the attack, move quickly to the opposite side of the arena to avoid the explosion. Lilith flies up and leaves the arena. After a brief delay, she comes back flying across the entire battlefield, covering the ground behind her in a thick layer of cursed blood. After a 3 second delay, the blood ignites, dealing lethal damage to all enemies caught in it for the next 2 seconds. There's always a safe zone at the side of the arena where Lilith finishes her flight. This attack is trivial to dodge on it's own and only becomes dangerous when combined with Souls chasing down the player. Remember that no damage is done until the blood catches fire, so you don't need to rush into the safe zone immediately. After player enters the arena, Lilith will drop down in the center, knocking the player back and creating a Circle of Doom that limits the size of the playable area. Stepping outside of the circle will deal extremely high damage over time to the player.

During this stage of the fight, Lilith has long cooldowns on her high-damage attacks, giving you plenty of time to damage her and/or apply Stagger. Be ready to dodge Wave of Spikes or Death From Above when they come and you should be able to get through this stage without much trouble. When Lilith's health goes below 70%, she will finish her attack and summon 2 Enforcers. After that, she will continuously use Death From Above as long as at least one of the Enforcers is alive (but no less than 2 times). Each Enforcer will leave behind 2 Volatile Bloods and  6 Health Potion charges upon death. Enforcers themselves deal almost no damage. Your primary focus should be on dodging the Death From Above spam while killing them. Stay at the edge of the arena and let the Enforcers come to you. Be mindful of their pull attack as it can move you into the one-shot attacks from Lilith. If your build is not great at cleaning up Volatile Blood, try to kill the minions one-by-one and kill the Blood in-between. After you kill both minions, the camera returns to the normal zoom level and the second stage of the fight begins. Lilith's abilities are upgraded: Her attacks, in general, will follow this pattern: Your best strategy is to focus on dodging during steps 1-3 and doing damage during step 4. Since her Blood Orb Creation now has reduced cooldown and still has highest priority, the attack in step 2 will often be Blood Orb Creation. It's recommended to focus on dodging the incoming Death From Above first and killing Volatile Bloods second. Since Volatile Bloods take 12 seconds to detonate, you have plenty of time to kill it without the threat of a one-shot hanging over you. When Lilith's health goes below 40%, she will finish her attack and summon 3 Oppressors. Same as the first minion phase, she will spam use Death From Above as long as her minions live. This phase is not very different from the first one. Now there are 3 minions instead of 2 but they pose little threat and all the danger is coming from now further upgraded Death From Above. Our strategy stays the same: focus on dodging first and killing second.

Lilith opens up the fight with a semi-fixed sequence of attacks: After that she behaves similar to her first phase. She casts Blood Orb Creation whenever its 15s cooldown is ready and otherwise randomly chooses between Melee Combo, Flight (~20s cooldown), and Shadow Clone (~20s cooldown). During this part of the fight, the only threatening attack Lilith has is Shadow Clone, but with plenty of space to dodge it, you can always run in a big circle and be completely fine. Instead, you should focus at dealing damage and managing Blood Orbs. When the Blood Orb Creation is coming up, move next to (or even inside of) one of the existing Blood Orbs to make sure that their numbers don't increase. Staggering Lilith at this stage is also beneficial as it will destroy some of the Blood Orbs. Alternatively, you can just run to the top of the arena to spawn new Blood Orbs, as this section of the arena will soon be destroyed. This, however, makes the next phase transition very hard to survive, so only do this if you have an Invulnerability skill to help you. After Lilith's HP falls below 85% she will finish her current attack and use Flight (bottom to top). After that, she performs a special move (Lilith can't be Staggered during this time) where she uses her wings to destroy part of the arena. This section overlaps with the safe zone of previously used Flight and players standing on it take minor damage over time. 6 seconds later, the cut-off section crumbles down into the abyss, instantly killing all players standing on it. While the platform is crumbling and for 2 second after, Blood Orbs shoot Souls at the player. 2 Souls are created each second, regardless of the number of currently active Blood Orbs.

Be aware that the pull from the Ground Slam attack will happen while there's still some Souls out, so you need to make sure that there are no Souls between you and arena's center when it happens (or simply use Unstoppable ability to prevent the pull). The second stage of the fight is no different from the first one, but now Lilith has one more ability to choose from: Ground Slam. The next stage begins when Lilith HP falls below 60% mark. Lilith will once again open up with Flight (bottom left to top right) and then will start breaking off the corner of the platform. Unlike the first time, the safe zone of Flight doesn't perfectly overlap with the crumbling platform and there's some burning blood in the left corner of it. There's nothing different in the way you dodge this attack but it's a bit more difficult because the safe zone and the arena itself is now smaller.

As she destroys the last platform, she will cast Shadow Clone. After this, the fight continues but Lilith now has no cooldown on her Flight ability and will often use it twice in a row in opposite directions, forcing you to run from one end of the arena to the other and stand in a tiny safe zone while dodging all the Souls coming for you. On top of that, the arena itself is so small now that you barely have space to dodge her Ground Slam and Shadow Clone attacks. Needless to say, staying alive and dealing damage is extremely difficult so it's recommended to Stagger Lilith either right before or right after the last transition and then deal as much damage as possible to shorten this stage of the fight or even outright kill her. The above description of the fight tells you what happens if you slowly and steadily deal damage to Lilith and she has plenty of time to perform all her special attacks. Things can be very different if your damage is overwhelmingly high and certain parts of the fight can be outright skipped. For example, if you deal 60% of Lilith's HP in one hit at the beginning of the fight, she will go up and then come down to summon Oppressors, and you will never have to fight any Enforcers. Now, most builds can't do that kind of damage but that's where Stagger comes in. Staggering Lilith lets you deal damage to her for 5 seconds uninterrupted and many builds can deal serious damage during that timeframe. If you Stagger her before she gets below 70% HP and then kill her before Stagger ends, you skip the most difficult parts of the first phase.

With base 100% Movement Speed, the wrong Boot implicit, and no mobility skills, many of Lilith's attacks become outright unavoidable. With a couple of Movement Speed rolls on your Boots and Amulet plus extra Evade charges, you can dodge everything she throws at you. Add in some mobility skills like and maybe an invulnerability button like and it becomes almost easy. Get at least 140% Movement Speed and either \"Max Evade Charges\" or \"Movement Speed after Evade\" roll on your boots. Similar to the Tormented Bosses of the Boss Ladder system, Lilith applies a stacking damage taken debuff to the player when hit by certain abilities. This allows a few mistakes throughout the fight before the incoming damage overwhelms you. These abilities are: It's advised to spec into a proper Bossing setup to complete the fight. Check out our to see the best builds! Lilith siphons the blood out of the player, dealing unavoidable damage and creating a Volatile Blood beneath their feet. At the same time, 3 Dancing Blood Orbs are created, which orbit the player's position for 5 seconds and then swiftly fly out of the arena. Getting hit by a Dancing Blood Orb deals minor damage and makes the player Vulnerable for 2.5 seconds.  This attack applies a stacking debuff to the player, which increases its damage by 2% per stack. The initial hit applies 2 stacks and each Dancing Blood Orb applies 1 stack on hit. is a common enemy with 1,200,000 HP. If not killed within 12 seconds, Volatile Blood erupts, dealing lethal damage in room-wide AoE. When Lilith is below 40% HP, this attack creates two Volatile Bloods. The initial hit is unavoidable its damage grows over time, so you need to have enough DPS to end the fight before you accumulate too many stacks of this debuff. Try to kill Volatile Blood as soon as possible. If you fail to do it in time, only abilities that make you can save you. Lilith takes 2 steps forward while striking the player twice with her wings. If the player is too far away, Lilith shadowsteps closer to them at the beginning of this attack. This attack can be easily outranged or side-stepped, but its damage is so low that most builds can just facetank it and use it as an opportunity to deal damage. Lilith creates a series of parallel fissures on the ground which explode after a 1 second delay, dealing damage to players standing on top of them. This version is used when Lilith is above 70% HP. Don't stand in the fire if you want to avoid the damage, but, similar to Melee Combo, this ability's damage is low enough for most builds to simply ignore it. Lilith creates two series of parallel fissures on the ground in a criss-cross pattern. Fissures explode after a 1 second delay, dealing damage to players standing on top of them. Standing on the intersection of two fissures deals damage twice. This version is used when Lilith is below 70% HP. The damage this ability stays the same but double-hit can be dangerous to more squishy builds, so don't stand on the intersection of two lines. Lilith turns to face the player and then summons two shadow clones of herself. After a brief delay, Lilith and her clones jump backwards while launching forward a wide wave of demonic spikes that deals lethal damage on contact. The easiest way to dodge this attack is to simply move behind Lilith while she is preparing the wave. If Lilith's back is to the edge of the arena and you can't stand behind her, you need to run backwards and to the side to get out of the way. In some cases the wave can be aimed directly through the arena's center, making it impossible to dodge without leaving the circle. To prevent this from happening, never stand between Lilith and the center of the arena when you both are close to the edge. Lilith leaps upward, briefly leaving the arena. After a 1.2 second delay, 3 warning markers are created on the ground: one directly next to the player and two more to the sides and slightly back. One second later, Lilith's shadow clones come crashing down and launch 3 narrow waves of demonic spikes from the position of the markers. Finally, Lilith herself comes down, launching the 4th wave down the middle lane from further back. This version is available at all times. As soon as you see Lilith crouch before her jump, start moving to the edge of the arena. If you get there fast enough, all the launching spots of the waves will be inside the circle. Then all you have to do is run to the opposite side until you get behind the 4th warning marker. This way you are never in a path of any waves and you are also right next to the Lilith's landing spot, ready to deal damage. If you fail to get to the edge of the arena in time, the safe areas may land outside the circle. In that case you have to dodge the attack the hard way. Move to the side of the first marker to let the wave pass you by. As soon as it passes, immediately get behind it to avoid the incoming side wave. Again, as soon as side wave passes, go behind it again to avoid the final wave coming down the middle. Keep in mind that the hitbox of the waves is slightly in front of them (which is further exacerbated by your latency), meaning that you will get hit before the wave even touches you. On the bright side, that also means that back side of the wave is quite safe: if you approach a wave from behind you can literally stand on top of the spikes without taking damage. Lilith leaps upward, briefly leaving the arena. After a 1.2 second delay, 3 warning markers are created on the ground: one directly next to the player and two more to the sides and far behind. One second later, Lilith's shadow clones come crashing down and launch 3 narrow waves of demonic spikes from the position of the markers. Finally Lilith herself comes down, launching the 4th wave down the middle lane from further back. This version is available when Lilith is below 70% HP. The exact same strategy can be used for this version: run to the edge, wait for marker, run to to opposite side to get behind the 4th wave. Since you always stay in the middle lane you don't have to worry about side waves no matter what direction they go. If you fail to get to the edge of the arena in time, you need to dodge differently. Get behind the first marker and then run behind the wave as closely as you can. When the side waves pass by, get out of the middle to avoid the incoming last wave. If the first marker is at the edge of the circle and you can't get behind it, simply run backwards and to the side to get behind one of the side waves. In this version, there are 3 waves going along the sides of a triangle in clockwise direction. Lilith herself comes down in the center of the triangle, dealing lethal damage in large circular AoE. This version is available when Lilith is below 40% HP. The general method of dodging remains the same: you need to get to one side of the circle so that the attack is aimed off-center, and then quickly dash to the safe area on the opposite site. Keep in mind that that the waves continue traveling past the vertices of the triangle so the to be safe you need to be completely outside it. Unlike the previous two versions, this attack leaves you with less time to react since you need to get out of the central AoE quickly. If you fail to get to the edge of the arena in time, there might be no safe zones at all and then only Invulnerability can save you. This version also has only 3 first waves from the second version. Instead of launching 4th wave down the middle, Lilith comes down directly next to the player, dealing lethal damage in large circular AoE. This version is available when Lilith is below 40% HP. The general method of dodging remains the same: you need to get to one side of the circle so that the attack is aimed off-center, and then quickly dash to the safe area on the opposite site. If you stay in the middle lane while doing that, don't forget about incoming wave that will come a few seconds later. Move left or right when the side waves pass you. If you fail to get to the edge of the arena in time, there might be no safe zones at all and then only Invulnerability can save you. Lilith plunges her tail into the ground while siphoning blood out of the player at the same time, dealing unavoidable damage and creating 8 Dancing Blood Orbs going around the player in two concentric circles. After a brief delay an explosion of blood goes off next to the player dealing damage and creating a new Blood Orb in the center. All previously created Blood Orbs caught in the explosion are destroyed. Dancing Blood Orbs deal minor damage and make the player Vulnerable for 2.5 seconds upon impact. After orbiting the player's original position for 5 seconds, Dancing Blood Orbs swiftly fly out of the arena. In this phase, Blood Orbs are not enemies but obstacles on the map. Stepping into a Blood Orb deals low damage over time to the player and slows them. During certain attacks in this phase, Blood Orbs create deadly Red Souls that chase down the player. If Lilith is Staggered, all Blood Orbs except two (selected at random) are destroyed. This attack applies a stacking debuff to the player, which increases its damage by 2% per stack. The initial hit and the blood explosion apply 2 stacks and each Dancing Blood Orb applies 1 stack on hit. The initial hit is unavoidable. Its damage grows over time, so you need to have enough DPS to end the fight before you accumulate too many stacks of the debuff. The explosion deals high damage but it's easy to dodge with Evade if you remember it's coming. This version of the attack does the same initial damage and creates Dancing Blood Orbs, but instead of creating a single blood explosion next to the player 4 explosions happen in different corners of the arena and 4 Blood Orbs are created. This version is used at the beginning of the second phase when there are no active Blood Orbs on the arena. It can be skipped completely if you manage to take Lilith below 85% health before she spawns them, making this entire phase significantly easier. Lilith strikes the player 1-3 times with her tail. Similar to first phase, the damage of this attack is so low that most builds can just facetank it and use it as an opportunity to deal damage. Lilith flies up into the air and pulls all enemies towards herself while slowing them for 3 seconds. At the same time, she summons 4-6 (depending on her HP) Children of Lilith. After a 2 second delay, Lilith slams down onto the ground, dealing lethal damage in a large circle. Children of Lilith are a ghoul type enemies who pose no threat on their own but can become a source of Souls during certain attacks. If you get hit by the pull + slow you won't be able to get out of the AoE by just running. You need to use an ability to prevent the pull or to remove the slow. Alternatively, you can use a mobility skill or 2-3 Evade charges to get out even while slowed. After dodging, kill the Children before continuing to fight Lilith. Lilith lets out a scream, knocking the player back. After that, Lilith dashes towards the player and shoots a three-pronged fork of shadows at the player, which deals heavy damage. Then she does this dash + fork combo a second time. At the same time, a shadow clone of Lilith is created nearby, which mimics her initial scream and two fork attacks with a 1 second delay. After all 4 forks are shot, Lilith slams the ground near player's position, releasing a massive shadow explosion that deals lethal damage. If Lilith is killed or Staggered during this attack, the shadow clone will continue acting on its own. Since Lilith's death animation is very long, you will receive no rewards for double KO. Very tanky builds can survive a single hit by a fork, but most have to dodge this attack entirely. To do that, move away from Lilith and run in a large circle. Each fork's middle prong is always aimed directly at you, so you will always dodge it as long as you move laterally. In doing so, you risk running into one of the side prongs, so you need to either be far enough away from Lilith or slow down a bit after you dodge the middle one. When Lilith raises her wings before the final part of the attack, move quickly to the opposite side of the arena to avoid the explosion. Lilith flies up and leaves the arena. After a brief delay, she comes back flying across the entire battlefield, covering the ground behind her in a thick layer of cursed blood. After a 3 second delay, the blood ignites, dealing lethal damage to all enemies caught in it for the next 2 seconds. There's always a safe zone at the side of the arena where Lilith finishes her flight. This attack is trivial to dodge on it's own and only becomes dangerous when combined with Souls chasing down the player. Remember that no damage is done until the blood catches fire, so you don't need to rush into the safe zone immediately. After player enters the arena, Lilith will drop down in the center, knocking the player back and creating a Circle of Doom that limits the size of the playable area. Stepping outside of the circle will deal extremely high damage over time to the player. The fight always starts with the fixed sequence of attacks: After that she will select one of 5 attacks available to her: Lilith will always prioritize Blood Orb Creation if it's not on cooldown. She will never do Melee Combo more than twice in a row. Otherwise the attacks are selected at random. During this stage of the fight, Lilith has long cooldowns on her high-damage attacks, giving you plenty of time to damage her and/or apply Stagger. Be ready to dodge Wave of Spikes or Death From Above when they come and you should be able to get through this stage without much trouble. When Lilith's health goes below 70%, she will finish her attack and summon 2 Enforcers. After that, she will continuously use Death From Above as long as at least one of the Enforcers is alive (but no less than 2 times). Each Enforcer will leave behind 2 Volatile Bloods and  6 Health Potion charges upon death. Enforcers themselves deal almost no damage. Your primary focus should be on dodging the Death From Above spam while killing them. Stay at the edge of the arena and let the Enforcers come to you. Be mindful of their pull attack as it can move you into the one-shot attacks from Lilith. If your build is not great at cleaning up Volatile Blood, try to kill the minions one-by-one and kill the Blood in-between. After you kill both minions, the camera returns to the normal zoom level and the second stage of the fight begins. Lilith's abilities are upgraded: Her attacks, in general, will follow this pattern: Your best strategy is to focus on dodging during steps 1-3 and doing damage during step 4. Since her Blood Orb Creation now has reduced cooldown and still has highest priority, the attack in step 2 will often be Blood Orb Creation. It's recommended to focus on dodging the incoming Death From Above first and killing Volatile Bloods second. Since Volatile Bloods take 12 seconds to detonate, you have plenty of time to kill it without the threat of a one-shot hanging over you. When Lilith's health goes below 40%, she will finish her attack and summon 3 Oppressors. Same as the first minion phase, she will spam use Death From Above as long as her minions live. This phase is not very different from the first one. Now there are 3 minions instead of 2 but they pose little threat and all the danger is coming from now further upgraded Death From Above. Our strategy stays the same: focus on dodging first and killing second. After the minions die, the fight continues with more improvements to Lilith's attacks: During this stage Lilith will simply use Death From Above after every 2-3 attacks giving you little time to deal damage. Stay at the edge of the arena at all times to make dodging easier and slowly work through her HP bar. When Lilith's HP hits 0, the circle created at the start of the fight will disappear and 20 seconds later Echo of Lilith, Mother of Mankind will spawn in the center. Lilith opens up the fight with a semi-fixed sequence of attacks: After that she behaves similar to her first phase. She casts Blood Orb Creation whenever its 15s cooldown is ready and otherwise randomly chooses between Melee Combo, Flight (~20s cooldown), and Shadow Clone (~20s cooldown). During this part of the fight, the only threatening attack Lilith has is Shadow Clone, but with plenty of space to dodge it, you can always run in a big circle and be completely fine. Instead, you should focus at dealing damage and managing Blood Orbs. When the Blood Orb Creation is coming up, move next to (or even inside of) one of the existing Blood Orbs to make sure that their numbers don't increase. Staggering Lilith at this stage is also beneficial as it will destroy some of the Blood Orbs. Alternatively, you can just run to the top of the arena to spawn new Blood Orbs, as this section of the arena will soon be destroyed. This, however, makes the next phase transition very hard to survive, so only do this if you have an Invulnerability skill to help you. After Lilith's HP falls below 85% she will finish her current attack and use Flight (bottom to top). After that, she performs a special move (Lilith can't be Staggered during this time) where she uses her wings to destroy part of the arena. This section overlaps with the safe zone of previously used Flight and players standing on it take minor damage over time. 6 seconds later, the cut-off section crumbles down into the abyss, instantly killing all players standing on it. While the platform is crumbling and for 2 second after, Blood Orbs shoot Souls at the player. 2 Souls are created each second, regardless of the number of currently active Blood Orbs. Souls move at ~133% Movement Speed and home in on their target, but their turn speed is very low, making it possible to sidestep them. Souls deal heavy damage on contact. After the platform is broken, Lilith teleports to the center of arena and uses Ground Slam. Dodging all these attacks can be tricky but it becomes much easier if you can outrun the Souls. Then you just have to run in a large circle, timing it in such a way that you enter the crumbling platform right before the blood on the floor starts burning, and then leave it before it falls down, all without stopping. In this case, you only have to worry about the Souls coming straight at you and you Evade or simply take a step to the side to dodge them. Be aware that the pull from the Ground Slam attack will happen while there's still some Souls out, so you need to make sure that there are no Souls between you and arena's center when it happens (or simply use Unstoppable ability to prevent the pull). The second stage of the fight is no different from the first one, but now Lilith has one more ability to choose from: Ground Slam. The next stage begins when Lilith HP falls below 60% mark. Lilith will once again open up with Flight (bottom left to top right) and then will start breaking off the corner of the platform. Unlike the first time, the safe zone of Flight doesn't perfectly overlap with the crumbling platform and there's some burning blood in the left corner of it. There's nothing different in the way you dodge this attack but it's a bit more difficult because the safe zone and the arena itself is now smaller. After the platform is broken, Lilith will teleport to the center and use Ground Slam. During this stage of the fight, Lilith doesn't gain any new abilities but she gets some upgrades: When Lilith falls below 30% HP, she will break the last corner of the platform, starting with Flight (bottom right to top left), then platform break with all the bells whistles and Souls. As she destroys the last platform, she will cast Shadow Clone. After this, the fight continues but Lilith now has no cooldown on her Flight ability and will often use it twice in a row in opposite directions, forcing you to run from one end of the arena to the other and stand in a tiny safe zone while dodging all the Souls coming for you. On top of that, the arena itself is so small now that you barely have space to dodge her Ground Slam and Shadow Clone attacks. Needless to say, staying alive and dealing damage is extremely difficult so it's recommended to Stagger Lilith either right before or right after the last transition and then deal as much damage as possible to shorten this stage of the fight or even outright kill her. The above description of the fight tells you what happens if you slowly and steadily deal damage to Lilith and she has plenty of time to perform all her special attacks. Things can be very different if your damage is overwhelmingly high and certain parts of the fight can be outright skipped. For example, if you deal 60% of Lilith's HP in one hit at the beginning of the fight, she will go up and then come down to summon Oppressors, and you will never have to fight any Enforcers. Now, most builds can't do that kind of damage but that's where Stagger comes in. Staggering Lilith lets you deal damage to her for 5 seconds uninterrupted and many builds can deal serious damage during that timeframe. If you Stagger her before she gets below 70% HP and then kill her before Stagger ends, you skip the most difficult parts of the first phase. If you manage to build stagger fast enough to Stagger her during the opening sequence of attacks, then you can finish the fight without dodging once. Depending on your damage output you can aim to stagger her at different HP thresholds: To manipulate the moment when Stagger happens you need to adjust the amount of stagger damage your build deals. There's two ways to do that: If you lack the damage to skip parts of the fight within one stagger, you can swap your gear during the fight. For example, you can use to build up Stagger and then switch to offensive gloves and during the Stagger. Reviewed by"

This version is used at the beginning of the second phase when there are no active Blood Orbs on the arena. It can be skipped completely if you manage to take Lilith below 85% health before she spawns them, making this entire phase significantly easier. Lilith strikes the player 1-3 times with her tail. Similar to first phase, the damage of this attack is so low that most builds can just facetank it and use it as an opportunity to deal damage. Lilith flies up into the air and pulls all enemies towards herself while slowing them for 3 seconds. At the same time, she summons 4-6 (depending on her HP) Children of Lilith. After a 2 second delay, Lilith slams down onto the ground, dealing lethal damage in a large circle. Children of Lilith are a ghoul type enemies who pose no threat on their own but can become a source of Souls during certain attacks. If you get hit by the pull + slow you won't be able to get out of the AoE by just running. You need to use an ability to prevent the pull or to remove the slow. Alternatively, you can use a mobility skill or 2-3 Evade charges to get out even while slowed. After dodging, kill the Children before continuing to fight Lilith. Lilith lets out a scream, knocking the player back. After that, Lilith dashes towards the player and shoots a three-pronged fork of shadows at the player, which deals heavy damage. Then she does this dash + fork combo a second time. At the same time, a shadow clone of Lilith is created nearby, which mimics her initial scream and two fork attacks with a 1 second delay. After all 4 forks are shot, Lilith slams the ground near player's position, releasing a massive shadow explosion that deals lethal damage. If Lilith is killed or Staggered during this attack, the shadow clone will continue acting on its own. Since Lilith's death animation is very long, you will receive no rewards for double KO. Very tanky builds can survive a single hit by a fork, but most have to dodge this attack entirely. To do that, move away from Lilith and run in a large circle. Each fork's middle prong is always aimed directly at you, so you will always dodge it as long as you move laterally. In doing so, you risk running into one of the side prongs, so you need to either be far enough away from Lilith or slow down a bit after you dodge the middle one. When Lilith raises her wings before the final part of the attack, move quickly to the opposite side of the arena to avoid the explosion. Lilith flies up and leaves the arena. After a brief delay, she comes back flying across the entire battlefield, covering the ground behind her in a thick layer of cursed blood. After a 3 second delay, the blood ignites, dealing lethal damage to all enemies caught in it for the next 2 seconds. There's always a safe zone at the side of the arena where Lilith finishes her flight. This attack is trivial to dodge on it's own and only becomes dangerous when combined with Souls chasing down the player. Remember that no damage is done until the blood catches fire, so you don't need to rush into the safe zone immediately. After player enters the arena, Lilith will drop down in the center, knocking the player back and creating a Circle of Doom that limits the size of the playable area. Stepping outside of the circle will deal extremely high damage over time to the player. The fight always starts with the fixed sequence of attacks: After that she will select one of 5 attacks available to her: Lilith will always prioritize Blood Orb Creation if it's not on cooldown. She will never do Melee Combo more than twice in a row. Otherwise the attacks are selected at random. During this stage of the fight, Lilith has long cooldowns on her high-damage attacks, giving you plenty of time to damage her and/or apply Stagger. Be ready to dodge Wave of Spikes or Death From Above when they come and you should be able to get through this stage without much trouble. When Lilith's health goes below 70%, she will finish her attack and summon 2 Enforcers. After that, she will continuously use Death From Above as long as at least one of the Enforcers is alive (but no less than 2 times). Each Enforcer will leave behind 2 Volatile Bloods and  6 Health Potion charges upon death. Enforcers themselves deal almost no damage. Your primary focus should be on dodging the Death From Above spam while killing them. Stay at the edge of the arena and let the Enforcers come to you. Be mindful of their pull attack as it can move you into the one-shot attacks from Lilith. If your build is not great at cleaning up Volatile Blood, try to kill the minions one-by-one and kill the Blood in-between. After you kill both minions, the camera returns to the normal zoom level and the second stage of the fight begins. Lilith's abilities are upgraded: Her attacks, in general, will follow this pattern: Your best strategy is to focus on dodging during steps 1-3 and doing damage during step 4. Since her Blood Orb Creation now has reduced cooldown and still has highest priority, the attack in step 2 will often be Blood Orb Creation. It's recommended to focus on dodging the incoming Death From Above first and killing Volatile Bloods second. Since Volatile Bloods take 12 seconds to detonate, you have plenty of time to kill it without the threat of a one-shot hanging over you. When Lilith's health goes below 40%, she will finish her attack and summon 3 Oppressors. Same as the first minion phase, she will spam use Death From Above as long as her minions live. This phase is not very different from the first one. Now there are 3 minions instead of 2 but they pose little threat and all the danger is coming from now further upgraded Death From Above. Our strategy stays the same: focus on dodging first and killing second. After the minions die, the fight continues with more improvements to Lilith's attacks: During this stage Lilith will simply use Death From Above after every 2-3 attacks giving you little time to deal damage. Stay at the edge of the arena at all times to make dodging easier and slowly work through her HP bar. When Lilith's HP hits 0, the circle created at the start of the fight will disappear and 20 seconds later Echo of Lilith, Mother of Mankind will spawn in the center. Lilith opens up the fight with a semi-fixed sequence of attacks: After that she behaves similar to her first phase. She casts Blood Orb Creation whenever its 15s cooldown is ready and otherwise randomly chooses between Melee Combo, Flight (~20s cooldown), and Shadow Clone (~20s cooldown). During this part of the fight, the only threatening attack Lilith has is Shadow Clone, but with plenty of space to dodge it, you can always run in a big circle and be completely fine. Instead, you should focus at dealing damage and managing Blood Orbs. When the Blood Orb Creation is coming up, move next to (or even inside of) one of the existing Blood Orbs to make sure that their numbers don't increase. Staggering Lilith at this stage is also beneficial as it will destroy some of the Blood Orbs. Alternatively, you can just run to the top of the arena to spawn new Blood Orbs, as this section of the arena will soon be destroyed. This, however, makes the next phase transition very hard to survive, so only do this if you have an Invulnerability skill to help you. After Lilith's HP falls below 85% she will finish her current attack and use Flight (bottom to top). After that, she performs a special move (Lilith can't be Staggered during this time) where she uses her wings to destroy part of the arena. This section overlaps with the safe zone of previously used Flight and players standing on it take minor damage over time. 6 seconds later, the cut-off section crumbles down into the abyss, instantly killing all players standing on it. While the platform is crumbling and for 2 second after, Blood Orbs shoot Souls at the player. 2 Souls are created each second, regardless of the number of currently active Blood Orbs. Souls move at ~133% Movement Speed and home in on their target, but their turn speed is very low, making it possible to sidestep them. Souls deal heavy damage on contact. After the platform is broken, Lilith teleports to the center of arena and uses Ground Slam. Dodging all these attacks can be tricky but it becomes much easier if you can outrun the Souls. Then you just have to run in a large circle, timing it in such a way that you enter the crumbling platform right before the blood on the floor starts burning, and then leave it before it falls down, all without stopping. In this case, you only have to worry about the Souls coming straight at you and you Evade or simply take a step to the side to dodge them. Be aware that the pull from the Ground Slam attack will happen while there's still some Souls out, so you need to make sure that there are no Souls between you and arena's center when it happens (or simply use Unstoppable ability to prevent the pull). The second stage of the fight is no different from the first one, but now Lilith has one more ability to choose from: Ground Slam. The next stage begins when Lilith HP falls below 60% mark. Lilith will once again open up with Flight (bottom left to top right) and then will start breaking off the corner of the platform. Unlike the first time, the safe zone of Flight doesn't perfectly overlap with the crumbling platform and there's some burning blood in the left corner of it. There's nothing different in the way you dodge this attack but it's a bit more difficult because the safe zone and the arena itself is now smaller. After the platform is broken, Lilith will teleport to the center and use Ground Slam. During this stage of the fight, Lilith doesn't gain any new abilities but she gets some upgrades: When Lilith falls below 30% HP, she will break the last corner of the platform, starting with Flight (bottom right to top left), then platform break with all the bells whistles and Souls. As she destroys the last platform, she will cast Shadow Clone. After this, the fight continues but Lilith now has no cooldown on her Flight ability and will often use it twice in a row in opposite directions, forcing you to run from one end of the arena to the other and stand in a tiny safe zone while dodging all the Souls coming for you. On top of that, the arena itself is so small now that you barely have space to dodge her Ground Slam and Shadow Clone attacks. Needless to say, staying alive and dealing damage is extremely difficult so it's recommended to Stagger Lilith either right before or right after the last transition and then deal as much damage as possible to shorten this stage of the fight or even outright kill her. The above description of the fight tells you what happens if you slowly and steadily deal damage to Lilith and she has plenty of time to perform all her special attacks. Things can be very different if your damage is overwhelmingly high and certain parts of the fight can be outright skipped. For example, if you deal 60% of Lilith's HP in one hit at the beginning of the fight, she will go up and then come down to summon Oppressors, and you will never have to fight any Enforcers. Now, most builds can't do that kind of damage but that's where Stagger comes in. Staggering Lilith lets you deal damage to her for 5 seconds uninterrupted and many builds can deal serious damage during that timeframe. If you Stagger her before she gets below 70% HP and then kill her before Stagger ends, you skip the most difficult parts of the first phase. If you manage to build stagger fast enough to Stagger her during the opening sequence of attacks, then you can finish the fight without dodging once. Depending on your damage output you can aim to stagger her at different HP thresholds: To manipulate the moment when Stagger happens you need to adjust the amount of stagger damage your build deals. There's two ways to do that: If you lack the damage to skip parts of the fight within one stagger, you can swap your gear during the fight. For example, you can use to build up Stagger and then switch to offensive gloves and during the Stagger. Reviewed by"

Check out our to see the best builds! Lilith siphons the blood out of the player, dealing unavoidable damage and creating a Volatile Blood beneath their feet. At the same time, 3 Dancing Blood Orbs are created, which orbit the player's position for 5 seconds and then swiftly fly out of the arena. Getting hit by a Dancing Blood Orb deals minor damage and makes the player Vulnerable for 2.5 seconds.  This attack applies a stacking debuff to the player, which increases its damage by 2% per stack. The initial hit applies 2 stacks and each Dancing Blood Orb applies 1 stack on hit. is a common enemy with 1,200,000 HP. If not killed within 12 seconds, Volatile Blood erupts, dealing lethal damage in room-wide AoE. When Lilith is below 40% HP, this attack creates two Volatile Bloods. The initial hit is unavoidable its damage grows over time, so you need to have enough DPS to end the fight before you accumulate too many stacks of this debuff. Try to kill Volatile Blood as soon as possible. If you fail to do it in time, only abilities that make you can save you. Lilith takes 2 steps forward while striking the player twice with her wings. If the player is too far away, Lilith shadowsteps closer to them at the beginning of this attack. This attack can be easily outranged or side-stepped, but its damage is so low that most builds can just facetank it and use it as an opportunity to deal damage. Lilith creates a series of parallel fissures on the ground which explode after a 1 second delay, dealing damage to players standing on top of them. This version is used when Lilith is above 70% HP. Don't stand in the fire if you want to avoid the damage, but, similar to Melee Combo, this ability's damage is low enough for most builds to simply ignore it. Lilith creates two series of parallel fissures on the ground in a criss-cross pattern. Fissures explode after a 1 second delay, dealing damage to players standing on top of them. Standing on the intersection of two fissures deals damage twice. This version is used when Lilith is below 70% HP. The damage this ability stays the same but double-hit can be dangerous to more squishy builds, so don't stand on the intersection of two lines. Lilith turns to face the player and then summons two shadow clones of herself. After a brief delay, Lilith and her clones jump backwards while launching forward a wide wave of demonic spikes that deals lethal damage on contact. The easiest way to dodge this attack is to simply move behind Lilith while she is preparing the wave. If Lilith's back is to the edge of the arena and you can't stand behind her, you need to run backwards and to the side to get out of the way. In some cases the wave can be aimed directly through the arena's center, making it impossible to dodge without leaving the circle. To prevent this from happening, never stand between Lilith and the center of the arena when you both are close to the edge. Lilith leaps upward, briefly leaving the arena. After a 1.2 second delay, 3 warning markers are created on the ground: one directly next to the player and two more to the sides and slightly back. One second later, Lilith's shadow clones come crashing down and launch 3 narrow waves of demonic spikes from the position of the markers. Finally, Lilith herself comes down, launching the 4th wave down the middle lane from further back. This version is available at all times. As soon as you see Lilith crouch before her jump, start moving to the edge of the arena. If you get there fast enough, all the launching spots of the waves will be inside the circle. Then all you have to do is run to the opposite side until you get behind the 4th warning marker. This way you are never in a path of any waves and you are also right next to the Lilith's landing spot, ready to deal damage. If you fail to get to the edge of the arena in time, the safe areas may land outside the circle. In that case you have to dodge the attack the hard way. Move to the side of the first marker to let the wave pass you by. As soon as it passes, immediately get behind it to avoid the incoming side wave. Again, as soon as side wave passes, go behind it again to avoid the final wave coming down the middle. Keep in mind that the hitbox of the waves is slightly in front of them (which is further exacerbated by your latency), meaning that you will get hit before the wave even touches you. On the bright side, that also means that back side of the wave is quite safe: if you approach a wave from behind you can literally stand on top of the spikes without taking damage. Lilith leaps upward, briefly leaving the arena. After a 1.2 second delay, 3 warning markers are created on the ground: one directly next to the player and two more to the sides and far behind. One second later, Lilith's shadow clones come crashing down and launch 3 narrow waves of demonic spikes from the position of the markers. Finally Lilith herself comes down, launching the 4th wave down the middle lane from further back. This version is available when Lilith is below 70% HP. The exact same strategy can be used for this version: run to the edge, wait for marker, run to to opposite side to get behind the 4th wave. Since you always stay in the middle lane you don't have to worry about side waves no matter what direction they go. If you fail to get to the edge of the arena in time, you need to dodge differently. Get behind the first marker and then run behind the wave as closely as you can. When the side waves pass by, get out of the middle to avoid the incoming last wave. If the first marker is at the edge of the circle and you can't get behind it, simply run backwards and to the side to get behind one of the side waves. In this version, there are 3 waves going along the sides of a triangle in clockwise direction. Lilith herself comes down in the center of the triangle, dealing lethal damage in large circular AoE. This version is available when Lilith is below 40% HP. The general method of dodging remains the same: you need to get to one side of the circle so that the attack is aimed off-center, and then quickly dash to the safe area on the opposite site. Keep in mind that that the waves continue traveling past the vertices of the triangle so the to be safe you need to be completely outside it. Unlike the previous two versions, this attack leaves you with less time to react since you need to get out of the central AoE quickly. If you fail to get to the edge of the arena in time, there might be no safe zones at all and then only Invulnerability can save you. This version also has only 3 first waves from the second version. Instead of launching 4th wave down the middle, Lilith comes down directly next to the player, dealing lethal damage in large circular AoE. This version is available when Lilith is below 40% HP. The general method of dodging remains the same: you need to get to one side of the circle so that the attack is aimed off-center, and then quickly dash to the safe area on the opposite site. If you stay in the middle lane while doing that, don't forget about incoming wave that will come a few seconds later. Move left or right when the side waves pass you. If you fail to get to the edge of the arena in time, there might be no safe zones at all and then only Invulnerability can save you. Lilith plunges her tail into the ground while siphoning blood out of the player at the same time, dealing unavoidable damage and creating 8 Dancing Blood Orbs going around the player in two concentric circles. After a brief delay an explosion of blood goes off next to the player dealing damage and creating a new Blood Orb in the center. All previously created Blood Orbs caught in the explosion are destroyed. Dancing Blood Orbs deal minor damage and make the player Vulnerable for 2.5 seconds upon impact. After orbiting the player's original position for 5 seconds, Dancing Blood Orbs swiftly fly out of the arena. In this phase, Blood Orbs are not enemies but obstacles on the map. Stepping into a Blood Orb deals low damage over time to the player and slows them. During certain attacks in this phase, Blood Orbs create deadly Red Souls that chase down the player. If Lilith is Staggered, all Blood Orbs except two (selected at random) are destroyed. This attack applies a stacking debuff to the player, which increases its damage by 2% per stack. The initial hit and the blood explosion apply 2 stacks and each Dancing Blood Orb applies 1 stack on hit. The initial hit is unavoidable. Its damage grows over time, so you need to have enough DPS to end the fight before you accumulate too many stacks of the debuff. The explosion deals high damage but it's easy to dodge with Evade if you remember it's coming. This version of the attack does the same initial damage and creates Dancing Blood Orbs, but instead of creating a single blood explosion next to the player 4 explosions happen in different corners of the arena and 4 Blood Orbs are created. This version is used at the beginning of the second phase when there are no active Blood Orbs on the arena. It can be skipped completely if you manage to take Lilith below 85% health before she spawns them, making this entire phase significantly easier. Lilith strikes the player 1-3 times with her tail. Similar to first phase, the damage of this attack is so low that most builds can just facetank it and use it as an opportunity to deal damage. Lilith flies up into the air and pulls all enemies towards herself while slowing them for 3 seconds. At the same time, she summons 4-6 (depending on her HP) Children of Lilith. After a 2 second delay, Lilith slams down onto the ground, dealing lethal damage in a large circle. Children of Lilith are a ghoul type enemies who pose no threat on their own but can become a source of Souls during certain attacks. If you get hit by the pull + slow you won't be able to get out of the AoE by just running. You need to use an ability to prevent the pull or to remove the slow. Alternatively, you can use a mobility skill or 2-3 Evade charges to get out even while slowed. After dodging, kill the Children before continuing to fight Lilith. Lilith lets out a scream, knocking the player back. After that, Lilith dashes towards the player and shoots a three-pronged fork of shadows at the player, which deals heavy damage. Then she does this dash + fork combo a second time. At the same time, a shadow clone of Lilith is created nearby, which mimics her initial scream and two fork attacks with a 1 second delay. After all 4 forks are shot, Lilith slams the ground near player's position, releasing a massive shadow explosion that deals lethal damage. If Lilith is killed or Staggered during this attack, the shadow clone will continue acting on its own. Since Lilith's death animation is very long, you will receive no rewards for double KO. Very tanky builds can survive a single hit by a fork, but most have to dodge this attack entirely. To do that, move away from Lilith and run in a large circle. Each fork's middle prong is always aimed directly at you, so you will always dodge it as long as you move laterally. In doing so, you risk running into one of the side prongs, so you need to either be far enough away from Lilith or slow down a bit after you dodge the middle one. When Lilith raises her wings before the final part of the attack, move quickly to the opposite side of the arena to avoid the explosion. Lilith flies up and leaves the arena. After a brief delay, she comes back flying across the entire battlefield, covering the ground behind her in a thick layer of cursed blood. After a 3 second delay, the blood ignites, dealing lethal damage to all enemies caught in it for the next 2 seconds. There's always a safe zone at the side of the arena where Lilith finishes her flight. This attack is trivial to dodge on it's own and only becomes dangerous when combined with Souls chasing down the player. Remember that no damage is done until the blood catches fire, so you don't need to rush into the safe zone immediately. After player enters the arena, Lilith will drop down in the center, knocking the player back and creating a Circle of Doom that limits the size of the playable area. Stepping outside of the circle will deal extremely high damage over time to the player. The fight always starts with the fixed sequence of attacks: After that she will select one of 5 attacks available to her: Lilith will always prioritize Blood Orb Creation if it's not on cooldown. She will never do Melee Combo more than twice in a row. Otherwise the attacks are selected at random. During this stage of the fight, Lilith has long cooldowns on her high-damage attacks, giving you plenty of time to damage her and/or apply Stagger. Be ready to dodge Wave of Spikes or Death From Above when they come and you should be able to get through this stage without much trouble. When Lilith's health goes below 70%, she will finish her attack and summon 2 Enforcers. After that, she will continuously use Death From Above as long as at least one of the Enforcers is alive (but no less than 2 times). Each Enforcer will leave behind 2 Volatile Bloods and  6 Health Potion charges upon death. Enforcers themselves deal almost no damage. Your primary focus should be on dodging the Death From Above spam while killing them. Stay at the edge of the arena and let the Enforcers come to you. Be mindful of their pull attack as it can move you into the one-shot attacks from Lilith. If your build is not great at cleaning up Volatile Blood, try to kill the minions one-by-one and kill the Blood in-between. After you kill both minions, the camera returns to the normal zoom level and the second stage of the fight begins. Lilith's abilities are upgraded: Her attacks, in general, will follow this pattern: Your best strategy is to focus on dodging during steps 1-3 and doing damage during step 4. Since her Blood Orb Creation now has reduced cooldown and still has highest priority, the attack in step 2 will often be Blood Orb Creation. It's recommended to focus on dodging the incoming Death From Above first and killing Volatile Bloods second. Since Volatile Bloods take 12 seconds to detonate, you have plenty of time to kill it without the threat of a one-shot hanging over you. When Lilith's health goes below 40%, she will finish her attack and summon 3 Oppressors. Same as the first minion phase, she will spam use Death From Above as long as her minions live. This phase is not very different from the first one. Now there are 3 minions instead of 2 but they pose little threat and all the danger is coming from now further upgraded Death From Above. Our strategy stays the same: focus on dodging first and killing second. After the minions die, the fight continues with more improvements to Lilith's attacks: During this stage Lilith will simply use Death From Above after every 2-3 attacks giving you little time to deal damage. Stay at the edge of the arena at all times to make dodging easier and slowly work through her HP bar. When Lilith's HP hits 0, the circle created at the start of the fight will disappear and 20 seconds later Echo of Lilith, Mother of Mankind will spawn in the center. Lilith opens up the fight with a semi-fixed sequence of attacks: After that she behaves similar to her first phase. She casts Blood Orb Creation whenever its 15s cooldown is ready and otherwise randomly chooses between Melee Combo, Flight (~20s cooldown), and Shadow Clone (~20s cooldown). During this part of the fight, the only threatening attack Lilith has is Shadow Clone, but with plenty of space to dodge it, you can always run in a big circle and be completely fine. Instead, you should focus at dealing damage and managing Blood Orbs. When the Blood Orb Creation is coming up, move next to (or even inside of) one of the existing Blood Orbs to make sure that their numbers don't increase. Staggering Lilith at this stage is also beneficial as it will destroy some of the Blood Orbs. Alternatively, you can just run to the top of the arena to spawn new Blood Orbs, as this section of the arena will soon be destroyed. This, however, makes the next phase transition very hard to survive, so only do this if you have an Invulnerability skill to help you. After Lilith's HP falls below 85% she will finish her current attack and use Flight (bottom to top). After that, she performs a special move (Lilith can't be Staggered during this time) where she uses her wings to destroy part of the arena. This section overlaps with the safe zone of previously used Flight and players standing on it take minor damage over time. 6 seconds later, the cut-off section crumbles down into the abyss, instantly killing all players standing on it. While the platform is crumbling and for 2 second after, Blood Orbs shoot Souls at the player. 2 Souls are created each second, regardless of the number of currently active Blood Orbs. Souls move at ~133% Movement Speed and home in on their target, but their turn speed is very low, making it possible to sidestep them. Souls deal heavy damage on contact. After the platform is broken, Lilith teleports to the center of arena and uses Ground Slam. Dodging all these attacks can be tricky but it becomes much easier if you can outrun the Souls. Then you just have to run in a large circle, timing it in such a way that you enter the crumbling platform right before the blood on the floor starts burning, and then leave it before it falls down, all without stopping. In this case, you only have to worry about the Souls coming straight at you and you Evade or simply take a step to the side to dodge them. Be aware that the pull from the Ground Slam attack will happen while there's still some Souls out, so you need to make sure that there are no Souls between you and arena's center when it happens (or simply use Unstoppable ability to prevent the pull). The second stage of the fight is no different from the first one, but now Lilith has one more ability to choose from: Ground Slam. The next stage begins when Lilith HP falls below 60% mark. Lilith will once again open up with Flight (bottom left to top right) and then will start breaking off the corner of the platform. Unlike the first time, the safe zone of Flight doesn't perfectly overlap with the crumbling platform and there's some burning blood in the left corner of it. There's nothing different in the way you dodge this attack but it's a bit more difficult because the safe zone and the arena itself is now smaller. After the platform is broken, Lilith will teleport to the center and use Ground Slam. During this stage of the fight, Lilith doesn't gain any new abilities but she gets some upgrades: When Lilith falls below 30% HP, she will break the last corner of the platform, starting with Flight (bottom right to top left), then platform break with all the bells whistles and Souls. As she destroys the last platform, she will cast Shadow Clone. After this, the fight continues but Lilith now has no cooldown on her Flight ability and will often use it twice in a row in opposite directions, forcing you to run from one end of the arena to the other and stand in a tiny safe zone while dodging all the Souls coming for you. On top of that, the arena itself is so small now that you barely have space to dodge her Ground Slam and Shadow Clone attacks. Needless to say, staying alive and dealing damage is extremely difficult so it's recommended to Stagger Lilith either right before or right after the last transition and then deal as much damage as possible to shorten this stage of the fight or even outright kill her. The above description of the fight tells you what happens if you slowly and steadily deal damage to Lilith and she has plenty of time to perform all her special attacks. Things can be very different if your damage is overwhelmingly high and certain parts of the fight can be outright skipped. For example, if you deal 60% of Lilith's HP in one hit at the beginning of the fight, she will go up and then come down to summon Oppressors, and you will never have to fight any Enforcers. Now, most builds can't do that kind of damage but that's where Stagger comes in. Staggering Lilith lets you deal damage to her for 5 seconds uninterrupted and many builds can deal serious damage during that timeframe. If you Stagger her before she gets below 70% HP and then kill her before Stagger ends, you skip the most difficult parts of the first phase. If you manage to build stagger fast enough to Stagger her during the opening sequence of attacks, then you can finish the fight without dodging once.

If not killed within 12 seconds, Volatile Blood erupts, dealing lethal damage in room-wide AoE. When Lilith is below 40% HP, this attack creates two Volatile Bloods. The initial hit is unavoidable its damage grows over time, so you need to have enough DPS to end the fight before you accumulate too many stacks of this debuff. Try to kill Volatile Blood as soon as possible. If you fail to do it in time, only abilities that make you can save you. Lilith takes 2 steps forward while striking the player twice with her wings. If the player is too far away, Lilith shadowsteps closer to them at the beginning of this attack. This attack can be easily outranged or side-stepped, but its damage is so low that most builds can just facetank it and use it as an opportunity to deal damage. Lilith creates a series of parallel fissures on the ground which explode after a 1 second delay, dealing damage to players standing on top of them. This version is used when Lilith is above 70% HP. Don't stand in the fire if you want to avoid the damage, but, similar to Melee Combo, this ability's damage is low enough for most builds to simply ignore it. Lilith creates two series of parallel fissures on the ground in a criss-cross pattern. Fissures explode after a 1 second delay, dealing damage to players standing on top of them. Standing on the intersection of two fissures deals damage twice. This version is used when Lilith is below 70% HP. The damage this ability stays the same but double-hit can be dangerous to more squishy builds, so don't stand on the intersection of two lines. Lilith turns to face the player and then summons two shadow clones of herself. After a brief delay, Lilith and her clones jump backwards while launching forward a wide wave of demonic spikes that deals lethal damage on contact. The easiest way to dodge this attack is to simply move behind Lilith while she is preparing the wave. If Lilith's back is to the edge of the arena and you can't stand behind her, you need to run backwards and to the side to get out of the way. In some cases the wave can be aimed directly through the arena's center, making it impossible to dodge without leaving the circle. To prevent this from happening, never stand between Lilith and the center of the arena when you both are close to the edge. Lilith leaps upward, briefly leaving the arena. After a 1.2 second delay, 3 warning markers are created on the ground: one directly next to the player and two more to the sides and slightly back. One second later, Lilith's shadow clones come crashing down and launch 3 narrow waves of demonic spikes from the position of the markers. Finally, Lilith herself comes down, launching the 4th wave down the middle lane from further back. This version is available at all times. As soon as you see Lilith crouch before her jump, start moving to the edge of the arena. If you get there fast enough, all the launching spots of the waves will be inside the circle. Then all you have to do is run to the opposite side until you get behind the 4th warning marker. This way you are never in a path of any waves and you are also right next to the Lilith's landing spot, ready to deal damage. If you fail to get to the edge of the arena in time, the safe areas may land outside the circle. In that case you have to dodge the attack the hard way. Move to the side of the first marker to let the wave pass you by. As soon as it passes, immediately get behind it to avoid the incoming side wave. Again, as soon as side wave passes, go behind it again to avoid the final wave coming down the middle. Keep in mind that the hitbox of the waves is slightly in front of them (which is further exacerbated by your latency), meaning that you will get hit before the wave even touches you. On the bright side, that also means that back side of the wave is quite safe: if you approach a wave from behind you can literally stand on top of the spikes without taking damage. Lilith leaps upward, briefly leaving the arena. After a 1.2 second delay, 3 warning markers are created on the ground: one directly next to the player and two more to the sides and far behind. One second later, Lilith's shadow clones come crashing down and launch 3 narrow waves of demonic spikes from the position of the markers. Finally Lilith herself comes down, launching the 4th wave down the middle lane from further back. This version is available when Lilith is below 70% HP. The exact same strategy can be used for this version: run to the edge, wait for marker, run to to opposite side to get behind the 4th wave. Since you always stay in the middle lane you don't have to worry about side waves no matter what direction they go. If you fail to get to the edge of the arena in time, you need to dodge differently. Get behind the first marker and then run behind the wave as closely as you can. When the side waves pass by, get out of the middle to avoid the incoming last wave. If the first marker is at the edge of the circle and you can't get behind it, simply run backwards and to the side to get behind one of the side waves. In this version, there are 3 waves going along the sides of a triangle in clockwise direction. Lilith herself comes down in the center of the triangle, dealing lethal damage in large circular AoE. This version is available when Lilith is below 40% HP. The general method of dodging remains the same: you need to get to one side of the circle so that the attack is aimed off-center, and then quickly dash to the safe area on the opposite site. Keep in mind that that the waves continue traveling past the vertices of the triangle so the to be safe you need to be completely outside it. Unlike the previous two versions, this attack leaves you with less time to react since you need to get out of the central AoE quickly. If you fail to get to the edge of the arena in time, there might be no safe zones at all and then only Invulnerability can save you. This version also has only 3 first waves from the second version. Instead of launching 4th wave down the middle, Lilith comes down directly next to the player, dealing lethal damage in large circular AoE. This version is available when Lilith is below 40% HP. The general method of dodging remains the same: you need to get to one side of the circle so that the attack is aimed off-center, and then quickly dash to the safe area on the opposite site. If you stay in the middle lane while doing that, don't forget about incoming wave that will come a few seconds later. Move left or right when the side waves pass you. If you fail to get to the edge of the arena in time, there might be no safe zones at all and then only Invulnerability can save you. Lilith plunges her tail into the ground while siphoning blood out of the player at the same time, dealing unavoidable damage and creating 8 Dancing Blood Orbs going around the player in two concentric circles. After a brief delay an explosion of blood goes off next to the player dealing damage and creating a new Blood Orb in the center. All previously created Blood Orbs caught in the explosion are destroyed. Dancing Blood Orbs deal minor damage and make the player Vulnerable for 2.5 seconds upon impact. After orbiting the player's original position for 5 seconds, Dancing Blood Orbs swiftly fly out of the arena. In this phase, Blood Orbs are not enemies but obstacles on the map. Stepping into a Blood Orb deals low damage over time to the player and slows them. During certain attacks in this phase, Blood Orbs create deadly Red Souls that chase down the player. If Lilith is Staggered, all Blood Orbs except two (selected at random) are destroyed. This attack applies a stacking debuff to the player, which increases its damage by 2% per stack. The initial hit and the blood explosion apply 2 stacks and each Dancing Blood Orb applies 1 stack on hit. The initial hit is unavoidable. Its damage grows over time, so you need to have enough DPS to end the fight before you accumulate too many stacks of the debuff. The explosion deals high damage but it's easy to dodge with Evade if you remember it's coming. This version of the attack does the same initial damage and creates Dancing Blood Orbs, but instead of creating a single blood explosion next to the player 4 explosions happen in different corners of the arena and 4 Blood Orbs are created. This version is used at the beginning of the second phase when there are no active Blood Orbs on the arena. It can be skipped completely if you manage to take Lilith below 85% health before she spawns them, making this entire phase significantly easier. Lilith strikes the player 1-3 times with her tail. Similar to first phase, the damage of this attack is so low that most builds can just facetank it and use it as an opportunity to deal damage. Lilith flies up into the air and pulls all enemies towards herself while slowing them for 3 seconds. At the same time, she summons 4-6 (depending on her HP) Children of Lilith. After a 2 second delay, Lilith slams down onto the ground, dealing lethal damage in a large circle. Children of Lilith are a ghoul type enemies who pose no threat on their own but can become a source of Souls during certain attacks. If you get hit by the pull + slow you won't be able to get out of the AoE by just running. You need to use an ability to prevent the pull or to remove the slow. Alternatively, you can use a mobility skill or 2-3 Evade charges to get out even while slowed. After dodging, kill the Children before continuing to fight Lilith. Lilith lets out a scream, knocking the player back. After that, Lilith dashes towards the player and shoots a three-pronged fork of shadows at the player, which deals heavy damage. Then she does this dash + fork combo a second time. At the same time, a shadow clone of Lilith is created nearby, which mimics her initial scream and two fork attacks with a 1 second delay. After all 4 forks are shot, Lilith slams the ground near player's position, releasing a massive shadow explosion that deals lethal damage. If Lilith is killed or Staggered during this attack, the shadow clone will continue acting on its own. Since Lilith's death animation is very long, you will receive no rewards for double KO. Very tanky builds can survive a single hit by a fork, but most have to dodge this attack entirely. To do that, move away from Lilith and run in a large circle. Each fork's middle prong is always aimed directly at you, so you will always dodge it as long as you move laterally. In doing so, you risk running into one of the side prongs, so you need to either be far enough away from Lilith or slow down a bit after you dodge the middle one. When Lilith raises her wings before the final part of the attack, move quickly to the opposite side of the arena to avoid the explosion. Lilith flies up and leaves the arena. After a brief delay, she comes back flying across the entire battlefield, covering the ground behind her in a thick layer of cursed blood. After a 3 second delay, the blood ignites, dealing lethal damage to all enemies caught in it for the next 2 seconds. There's always a safe zone at the side of the arena where Lilith finishes her flight. This attack is trivial to dodge on it's own and only becomes dangerous when combined with Souls chasing down the player. Remember that no damage is done until the blood catches fire, so you don't need to rush into the safe zone immediately. After player enters the arena, Lilith will drop down in the center, knocking the player back and creating a Circle of Doom that limits the size of the playable area. Stepping outside of the circle will deal extremely high damage over time to the player. The fight always starts with the fixed sequence of attacks: After that she will select one of 5 attacks available to her: Lilith will always prioritize Blood Orb Creation if it's not on cooldown. She will never do Melee Combo more than twice in a row. Otherwise the attacks are selected at random."

After player enters the arena, Lilith will drop down in the center, knocking the player back and creating a Circle of Doom that limits the size of the playable area. Stepping outside of the circle will deal extremely high damage over time to the player. The fight always starts with the fixed sequence of attacks: After that she will select one of 5 attacks available to her: Lilith will always prioritize Blood Orb Creation if it's not on cooldown. She will never do Melee Combo more than twice in a row. Otherwise the attacks are selected at random. During this stage of the fight, Lilith has long cooldowns on her high-damage attacks, giving you plenty of time to damage her and/or apply Stagger. Be ready to dodge Wave of Spikes or Death From Above when they come and you should be able to get through this stage without much trouble. When Lilith's health goes below 70%, she will finish her attack and summon 2 Enforcers. After that, she will continuously use Death From Above as long as at least one of the Enforcers is alive (but no less than 2 times). Each Enforcer will leave behind 2 Volatile Bloods and  6 Health Potion charges upon death. Enforcers themselves deal almost no damage. Your primary focus should be on dodging the Death From Above spam while killing them. Stay at the edge of the arena and let the Enforcers come to you. Be mindful of their pull attack as it can move you into the one-shot attacks from Lilith. If your build is not great at cleaning up Volatile Blood, try to kill the minions one-by-one and kill the Blood in-between. After you kill both minions, the camera returns to the normal zoom level and the second stage of the fight begins. Lilith's abilities are upgraded: Her attacks, in general, will follow this pattern: Your best strategy is to focus on dodging during steps 1-3 and doing damage during step 4. Since her Blood Orb Creation now has reduced cooldown and still has highest priority, the attack in step 2 will often be Blood Orb Creation. It's recommended to focus on dodging the incoming Death From Above first and killing Volatile Bloods second. Since Volatile Bloods take 12 seconds to detonate, you have plenty of time to kill it without the threat of a one-shot hanging over you. When Lilith's health goes below 40%, she will finish her attack and summon 3 Oppressors. Same as the first minion phase, she will spam use Death From Above as long as her minions live. This phase is not very different from the first one. Now there are 3 minions instead of 2 but they pose little threat and all the danger is coming from now further upgraded Death From Above. Our strategy stays the same: focus on dodging first and killing second. After the minions die, the fight continues with more improvements to Lilith's attacks: During this stage Lilith will simply use Death From Above after every 2-3 attacks giving you little time to deal damage. Stay at the edge of the arena at all times to make dodging easier and slowly work through her HP bar. When Lilith's HP hits 0, the circle created at the start of the fight will disappear and 20 seconds later Echo of Lilith, Mother of Mankind will spawn in the center. Lilith opens up the fight with a semi-fixed sequence of attacks: After that she behaves similar to her first phase. She casts Blood Orb Creation whenever its 15s cooldown is ready and otherwise randomly chooses between Melee Combo, Flight (~20s cooldown), and Shadow Clone (~20s cooldown). During this part of the fight, the only threatening attack Lilith has is Shadow Clone, but with plenty of space to dodge it, you can always run in a big circle and be completely fine. Instead, you should focus at dealing damage and managing Blood Orbs. When the Blood Orb Creation is coming up, move next to (or even inside of) one of the existing Blood Orbs to make sure that their numbers don't increase. Staggering Lilith at this stage is also beneficial as it will destroy some of the Blood Orbs. Alternatively, you can just run to the top of the arena to spawn new Blood Orbs, as this section of the arena will soon be destroyed. This, however, makes the next phase transition very hard to survive, so only do this if you have an Invulnerability skill to help you. After Lilith's HP falls below 85% she will finish her current attack and use Flight (bottom to top). After that, she performs a special move (Lilith can't be Staggered during this time) where she uses her wings to destroy part of the arena. This section overlaps with the safe zone of previously used Flight and players standing on it take minor damage over time. 6 seconds later, the cut-off section crumbles down into the abyss, instantly killing all players standing on it. While the platform is crumbling and for 2 second after, Blood Orbs shoot Souls at the player. 2 Souls are created each second, regardless of the number of currently active Blood Orbs. Souls move at ~133% Movement Speed and home in on their target, but their turn speed is very low, making it possible to sidestep them. Souls deal heavy damage on contact. After the platform is broken, Lilith teleports to the center of arena and uses Ground Slam. Dodging all these attacks can be tricky but it becomes much easier if you can outrun the Souls. Then you just have to run in a large circle, timing it in such a way that you enter the crumbling platform right before the blood on the floor starts burning, and then leave it before it falls down, all without stopping. In this case, you only have to worry about the Souls coming straight at you and you Evade or simply take a step to the side to dodge them. Be aware that the pull from the Ground Slam attack will happen while there's still some Souls out, so you need to make sure that there are no Souls between you and arena's center when it happens (or simply use Unstoppable ability to prevent the pull). The second stage of the fight is no different from the first one, but now Lilith has one more ability to choose from: Ground Slam. The next stage begins when Lilith HP falls below 60% mark. Lilith will once again open up with Flight (bottom left to top right) and then will start breaking off the corner of the platform. Unlike the first time, the safe zone of Flight doesn't perfectly overlap with the crumbling platform and there's some burning blood in the left corner of it. There's nothing different in the way you dodge this attack but it's a bit more difficult because the safe zone and the arena itself is now smaller. After the platform is broken, Lilith will teleport to the center and use Ground Slam. During this stage of the fight, Lilith doesn't gain any new abilities but she gets some upgrades: When Lilith falls below 30% HP, she will break the last corner of the platform, starting with Flight (bottom right to top left), then platform break with all the bells whistles and Souls. As she destroys the last platform, she will cast Shadow Clone. After this, the fight continues but Lilith now has no cooldown on her Flight ability and will often use it twice in a row in opposite directions, forcing you to run from one end of the arena to the other and stand in a tiny safe zone while dodging all the Souls coming for you. On top of that, the arena itself is so small now that you barely have space to dodge her Ground Slam and Shadow Clone attacks. Needless to say, staying alive and dealing damage is extremely difficult so it's recommended to Stagger Lilith either right before or right after the last transition and then deal as much damage as possible to shorten this stage of the fight or even outright kill her. The above description of the fight tells you what happens if you slowly and steadily deal damage to Lilith and she has plenty of time to perform all her special attacks. Things can be very different if your damage is overwhelmingly high and certain parts of the fight can be outright skipped. For example, if you deal 60% of Lilith's HP in one hit at the beginning of the fight, she will go up and then come down to summon Oppressors, and you will never have to fight any Enforcers. Now, most builds can't do that kind of damage but that's where Stagger comes in. Staggering Lilith lets you deal damage to her for 5 seconds uninterrupted and many builds can deal serious damage during that timeframe. If you Stagger her before she gets below 70% HP and then kill her before Stagger ends, you skip the most difficult parts of the first phase. If you manage to build stagger fast enough to Stagger her during the opening sequence of attacks, then you can finish the fight without dodging once. Depending on your damage output you can aim to stagger her at different HP thresholds: To manipulate the moment when Stagger happens you need to adjust the amount of stagger damage your build deals. There's two ways to do that: If you lack the damage to skip parts of the fight within one stagger, you can swap your gear during the fight. For example, you can use to build up Stagger and then switch to offensive gloves and during the Stagger. Reviewed by"

Lilith creates a series of parallel fissures on the ground which explode after a 1 second delay, dealing damage to players standing on top of them. This version is used when Lilith is above 70% HP. Don't stand in the fire if you want to avoid the damage, but, similar to Melee Combo, this ability's damage is low enough for most builds to simply ignore it. Lilith creates two series of parallel fissures on the ground in a criss-cross pattern. Fissures explode after a 1 second delay, dealing damage to players standing on top of them. Standing on the intersection of two fissures deals damage twice. This version is used when Lilith is below 70% HP. The damage this ability stays the same but double-hit can be dangerous to more squishy builds, so don't stand on the intersection of two lines. Lilith turns to face the player and then summons two shadow clones of herself. After a brief delay, Lilith and her clones jump backwards while launching forward a wide wave of demonic spikes that deals lethal damage on contact. The easiest way to dodge this attack is to simply move behind Lilith while she is preparing the wave. If Lilith's back is to the edge of the arena and you can't stand behind her, you need to run backwards and to the side to get out of the way. In some cases the wave can be aimed directly through the arena's center, making it impossible to dodge without leaving the circle. To prevent this from happening, never stand between Lilith and the center of the arena when you both are close to the edge. Lilith leaps upward, briefly leaving the arena. After a 1.2 second delay, 3 warning markers are created on the ground: one directly next to the player and two more to the sides and slightly back. One second later, Lilith's shadow clones come crashing down and launch 3 narrow waves of demonic spikes from the position of the markers. Finally, Lilith herself comes down, launching the 4th wave down the middle lane from further back. This version is available at all times. As soon as you see Lilith crouch before her jump, start moving to the edge of the arena. If you get there fast enough, all the launching spots of the waves will be inside the circle. Then all you have to do is run to the opposite side until you get behind the 4th warning marker. This way you are never in a path of any waves and you are also right next to the Lilith's landing spot, ready to deal damage. If you fail to get to the edge of the arena in time, the safe areas may land outside the circle. In that case you have to dodge the attack the hard way. Move to the side of the first marker to let the wave pass you by. As soon as it passes, immediately get behind it to avoid the incoming side wave. Again, as soon as side wave passes, go behind it again to avoid the final wave coming down the middle. Keep in mind that the hitbox of the waves is slightly in front of them (which is further exacerbated by your latency), meaning that you will get hit before the wave even touches you. On the bright side, that also means that back side of the wave is quite safe: if you approach a wave from behind you can literally stand on top of the spikes without taking damage. Lilith leaps upward, briefly leaving the arena. After a 1.2 second delay, 3 warning markers are created on the ground: one directly next to the player and two more to the sides and far behind. One second later, Lilith's shadow clones come crashing down and launch 3 narrow waves of demonic spikes from the position of the markers. Finally Lilith herself comes down, launching the 4th wave down the middle lane from further back. This version is available when Lilith is below 70% HP. The exact same strategy can be used for this version: run to the edge, wait for marker, run to to opposite side to get behind the 4th wave. Since you always stay in the middle lane you don't have to worry about side waves no matter what direction they go. If you fail to get to the edge of the arena in time, you need to dodge differently. Get behind the first marker and then run behind the wave as closely as you can. When the side waves pass by, get out of the middle to avoid the incoming last wave. If the first marker is at the edge of the circle and you can't get behind it, simply run backwards and to the side to get behind one of the side waves. In this version, there are 3 waves going along the sides of a triangle in clockwise direction. Lilith herself comes down in the center of the triangle, dealing lethal damage in large circular AoE. This version is available when Lilith is below 40% HP. The general method of dodging remains the same: you need to get to one side of the circle so that the attack is aimed off-center, and then quickly dash to the safe area on the opposite site. Keep in mind that that the waves continue traveling past the vertices of the triangle so the to be safe you need to be completely outside it. Unlike the previous two versions, this attack leaves you with less time to react since you need to get out of the central AoE quickly. If you fail to get to the edge of the arena in time, there might be no safe zones at all and then only Invulnerability can save you. This version also has only 3 first waves from the second version. Instead of launching 4th wave down the middle, Lilith comes down directly next to the player, dealing lethal damage in large circular AoE. This version is available when Lilith is below 40% HP. The general method of dodging remains the same: you need to get to one side of the circle so that the attack is aimed off-center, and then quickly dash to the safe area on the opposite site. If you stay in the middle lane while doing that, don't forget about incoming wave that will come a few seconds later. Move left or right when the side waves pass you. If you fail to get to the edge of the arena in time, there might be no safe zones at all and then only Invulnerability can save you. Lilith plunges her tail into the ground while siphoning blood out of the player at the same time, dealing unavoidable damage and creating 8 Dancing Blood Orbs going around the player in two concentric circles. After a brief delay an explosion of blood goes off next to the player dealing damage and creating a new Blood Orb in the center. All previously created Blood Orbs caught in the explosion are destroyed. Dancing Blood Orbs deal minor damage and make the player Vulnerable for 2.5 seconds upon impact. After orbiting the player's original position for 5 seconds, Dancing Blood Orbs swiftly fly out of the arena. In this phase, Blood Orbs are not enemies but obstacles on the map. Stepping into a Blood Orb deals low damage over time to the player and slows them. During certain attacks in this phase, Blood Orbs create deadly Red Souls that chase down the player. If Lilith is Staggered, all Blood Orbs except two (selected at random) are destroyed. This attack applies a stacking debuff to the player, which increases its damage by 2% per stack. The initial hit and the blood explosion apply 2 stacks and each Dancing Blood Orb applies 1 stack on hit. The initial hit is unavoidable. Its damage grows over time, so you need to have enough DPS to end the fight before you accumulate too many stacks of the debuff. The explosion deals high damage but it's easy to dodge with Evade if you remember it's coming. This version of the attack does the same initial damage and creates Dancing Blood Orbs, but instead of creating a single blood explosion next to the player 4 explosions happen in different corners of the arena and 4 Blood Orbs are created. This version is used at the beginning of the second phase when there are no active Blood Orbs on the arena. It can be skipped completely if you manage to take Lilith below 85% health before she spawns them, making this entire phase significantly easier. Lilith strikes the player 1-3 times with her tail. Similar to first phase, the damage of this attack is so low that most builds can just facetank it and use it as an opportunity to deal damage. Lilith flies up into the air and pulls all enemies towards herself while slowing them for 3 seconds. At the same time, she summons 4-6 (depending on her HP) Children of Lilith. After a 2 second delay, Lilith slams down onto the ground, dealing lethal damage in a large circle. Children of Lilith are a ghoul type enemies who pose no threat on their own but can become a source of Souls during certain attacks. If you get hit by the pull + slow you won't be able to get out of the AoE by just running. You need to use an ability to prevent the pull or to remove the slow. Alternatively, you can use a mobility skill or 2-3 Evade charges to get out even while slowed. After dodging, kill the Children before continuing to fight Lilith. Lilith lets out a scream, knocking the player back. After that, Lilith dashes towards the player and shoots a three-pronged fork of shadows at the player, which deals heavy damage. Then she does this dash + fork combo a second time. At the same time, a shadow clone of Lilith is created nearby, which mimics her initial scream and two fork attacks with a 1 second delay. After all 4 forks are shot, Lilith slams the ground near player's position, releasing a massive shadow explosion that deals lethal damage. If Lilith is killed or Staggered during this attack, the shadow clone will continue acting on its own. Since Lilith's death animation is very long, you will receive no rewards for double KO. Very tanky builds can survive a single hit by a fork, but most have to dodge this attack entirely. To do that, move away from Lilith and run in a large circle. Each fork's middle prong is always aimed directly at you, so you will always dodge it as long as you move laterally. In doing so, you risk running into one of the side prongs, so you need to either be far enough away from Lilith or slow down a bit after you dodge the middle one. When Lilith raises her wings before the final part of the attack, move quickly to the opposite side of the arena to avoid the explosion. Lilith flies up and leaves the arena. After a brief delay, she comes back flying across the entire battlefield, covering the ground behind her in a thick layer of cursed blood. After a 3 second delay, the blood ignites, dealing lethal damage to all enemies caught in it for the next 2 seconds. There's always a safe zone at the side of the arena where Lilith finishes her flight. This attack is trivial to dodge on it's own and only becomes dangerous when combined with Souls chasing down the player. Remember that no damage is done until the blood catches fire, so you don't need to rush into the safe zone immediately. After player enters the arena, Lilith will drop down in the center, knocking the player back and creating a Circle of Doom that limits the size of the playable area. Stepping outside of the circle will deal extremely high damage over time to the player. The fight always starts with the fixed sequence of attacks: After that she will select one of 5 attacks available to her: Lilith will always prioritize Blood Orb Creation if it's not on cooldown. She will never do Melee Combo more than twice in a row. Otherwise the attacks are selected at random. During this stage of the fight, Lilith has long cooldowns on her high-damage attacks, giving you plenty of time to damage her and/or apply Stagger. Be ready to dodge Wave of Spikes or Death From Above when they come and you should be able to get through this stage without much trouble. When Lilith's health goes below 70%, she will finish her attack and summon 2 Enforcers. After that, she will continuously use Death From Above as long as at least one of the Enforcers is alive (but no less than 2 times). Each Enforcer will leave behind 2 Volatile Bloods and  6 Health Potion charges upon death. Enforcers themselves deal almost no damage. Your primary focus should be on dodging the Death From Above spam while killing them. Stay at the edge of the arena and let the Enforcers come to you. Be mindful of their pull attack as it can move you into the one-shot attacks from Lilith. If your build is not great at cleaning up Volatile Blood, try to kill the minions one-by-one and kill the Blood in-between. After you kill both minions, the camera returns to the normal zoom level and the second stage of the fight begins. Lilith's abilities are upgraded: Her attacks, in general, will follow this pattern: Your best strategy is to focus on dodging during steps 1-3 and doing damage during step 4. Since her Blood Orb Creation now has reduced cooldown and still has highest priority, the attack in step 2 will often be Blood Orb Creation. It's recommended to focus on dodging the incoming Death From Above first and killing Volatile Bloods second. Since Volatile Bloods take 12 seconds to detonate, you have plenty of time to kill it without the threat of a one-shot hanging over you. When Lilith's health goes below 40%, she will finish her attack and summon 3 Oppressors. Same as the first minion phase, she will spam use Death From Above as long as her minions live. This phase is not very different from the first one. Now there are 3 minions instead of 2 but they pose little threat and all the danger is coming from now further upgraded Death From Above. Our strategy stays the same: focus on dodging first and killing second. After the minions die, the fight continues with more improvements to Lilith's attacks: During this stage Lilith will simply use Death From Above after every 2-3 attacks giving you little time to deal damage. Stay at the edge of the arena at all times to make dodging easier and slowly work through her HP bar. When Lilith's HP hits 0, the circle created at the start of the fight will disappear and 20 seconds later Echo of Lilith, Mother of Mankind will spawn in the center. Lilith opens up the fight with a semi-fixed sequence of attacks: After that she behaves similar to her first phase. She casts Blood Orb Creation whenever its 15s cooldown is ready and otherwise randomly chooses between Melee Combo, Flight (~20s cooldown), and Shadow Clone (~20s cooldown). During this part of the fight, the only threatening attack Lilith has is Shadow Clone, but with plenty of space to dodge it, you can always run in a big circle and be completely fine. Instead, you should focus at dealing damage and managing Blood Orbs. When the Blood Orb Creation is coming up, move next to (or even inside of) one of the existing Blood Orbs to make sure that their numbers don't increase. Staggering Lilith at this stage is also beneficial as it will destroy some of the Blood Orbs. Alternatively, you can just run to the top of the arena to spawn new Blood Orbs, as this section of the arena will soon be destroyed. This, however, makes the next phase transition very hard to survive, so only do this if you have an Invulnerability skill to help you. After Lilith's HP falls below 85% she will finish her current attack and use Flight (bottom to top). After that, she performs a special move (Lilith can't be Staggered during this time) where she uses her wings to destroy part of the arena. This section overlaps with the safe zone of previously used Flight and players standing on it take minor damage over time. 6 seconds later, the cut-off section crumbles down into the abyss, instantly killing all players standing on it. While the platform is crumbling and for 2 second after, Blood Orbs shoot Souls at the player. 2 Souls are created each second, regardless of the number of currently active Blood Orbs. Souls move at ~133% Movement Speed and home in on their target, but their turn speed is very low, making it possible to sidestep them. Souls deal heavy damage on contact. After the platform is broken, Lilith teleports to the center of arena and uses Ground Slam. Dodging all these attacks can be tricky but it becomes much easier if you can outrun the Souls. Then you just have to run in a large circle, timing it in such a way that you enter the crumbling platform right before the blood on the floor starts burning, and then leave it before it falls down, all without stopping. In this case, you only have to worry about the Souls coming straight at you and you Evade or simply take a step to the side to dodge them. Be aware that the pull from the Ground Slam attack will happen while there's still some Souls out, so you need to make sure that there are no Souls between you and arena's center when it happens (or simply use Unstoppable ability to prevent the pull). The second stage of the fight is no different from the first one, but now Lilith has one more ability to choose from: Ground Slam. The next stage begins when Lilith HP falls below 60% mark. Lilith will once again open up with Flight (bottom left to top right) and then will start breaking off the corner of the platform. Unlike the first time, the safe zone of Flight doesn't perfectly overlap with the crumbling platform and there's some burning blood in the left corner of it. There's nothing different in the way you dodge this attack but it's a bit more difficult because the safe zone and the arena itself is now smaller. After the platform is broken, Lilith will teleport to the center and use Ground Slam. During this stage of the fight, Lilith doesn't gain any new abilities but she gets some upgrades: When Lilith falls below 30% HP, she will break the last corner of the platform, starting with Flight (bottom right to top left), then platform break with all the bells whistles and Souls. As she destroys the last platform, she will cast Shadow Clone. After this, the fight continues but Lilith now has no cooldown on her Flight ability and will often use it twice in a row in opposite directions, forcing you to run from one end of the arena to the other and stand in a tiny safe zone while dodging all the Souls coming for you. On top of that, the arena itself is so small now that you barely have space to dodge her Ground Slam and Shadow Clone attacks. Needless to say, staying alive and dealing damage is extremely difficult so it's recommended to Stagger Lilith either right before or right after the last transition and then deal as much damage as possible to shorten this stage of the fight or even outright kill her. The above description of the fight tells you what happens if you slowly and steadily deal damage to Lilith and she has plenty of time to perform all her special attacks. Things can be very different if your damage is overwhelmingly high and certain parts of the fight can be outright skipped. For example, if you deal 60% of Lilith's HP in one hit at the beginning of the fight, she will go up and then come down to summon Oppressors, and you will never have to fight any Enforcers. Now, most builds can't do that kind of damage but that's where Stagger comes in. Staggering Lilith lets you deal damage to her for 5 seconds uninterrupted and many builds can deal serious damage during that timeframe. If you Stagger her before she gets below 70% HP and then kill her before Stagger ends, you skip the most difficult parts of the first phase. If you manage to build stagger fast enough to Stagger her during the opening sequence of attacks, then you can finish the fight without dodging once. Depending on your damage output you can aim to stagger her at different HP thresholds: To manipulate the moment when Stagger happens you need to adjust the amount of stagger damage your build deals. There's two ways to do that: If you lack the damage to skip parts of the fight within one stagger, you can swap your gear during the fight. For example, you can use to build up Stagger and then switch to offensive gloves and during the Stagger. Reviewed by"

If not killed within 12 seconds, Volatile Blood erupts, dealing lethal damage in room-wide AoE. When Lilith is below 40% HP, this attack creates two Volatile Bloods. The initial hit is unavoidable its damage grows over time, so you need to have enough DPS to end the fight before you accumulate too many stacks of this debuff. Try to kill Volatile Blood as soon as possible. If you fail to do it in time, only abilities that make you can save you. Lilith takes 2 steps forward while striking the player twice with her wings.

Lilith plunges her tail into the ground while siphoning blood out of the player at the same time, dealing unavoidable damage and creating 8 Dancing Blood Orbs going around the player in two concentric circles. After a brief delay an explosion of blood goes off next to the player dealing damage and creating a new Blood Orb in the center. All previously created Blood Orbs caught in the explosion are destroyed. Dancing Blood Orbs deal minor damage and make the player Vulnerable for 2.5 seconds upon impact. After orbiting the player's original position for 5 seconds, Dancing Blood Orbs swiftly fly out of the arena. In this phase, Blood Orbs are not enemies but obstacles on the map. Stepping into a Blood Orb deals low damage over time to the player and slows them. During certain attacks in this phase, Blood Orbs create deadly Red Souls that chase down the player. If Lilith is Staggered, all Blood Orbs except two (selected at random) are destroyed. This attack applies a stacking debuff to the player, which increases its damage by 2% per stack. The initial hit and the blood explosion apply 2 stacks and each Dancing Blood Orb applies 1 stack on hit. The initial hit is unavoidable. Its damage grows over time, so you need to have enough DPS to end the fight before you accumulate too many stacks of the debuff. The explosion deals high damage but it's easy to dodge with Evade if you remember it's coming. This version of the attack does the same initial damage and creates Dancing Blood Orbs, but instead of creating a single blood explosion next to the player 4 explosions happen in different corners of the arena and 4 Blood Orbs are created. This version is used at the beginning of the second phase when there are no active Blood Orbs on the arena. It can be skipped completely if you manage to take Lilith below 85% health before she spawns them, making this entire phase significantly easier. Lilith strikes the player 1-3 times with her tail. Similar to first phase, the damage of this attack is so low that most builds can just facetank it and use it as an opportunity to deal damage. Lilith flies up into the air and pulls all enemies towards herself while slowing them for 3 seconds. At the same time, she summons 4-6 (depending on her HP) Children of Lilith. After a 2 second delay, Lilith slams down onto the ground, dealing lethal damage in a large circle. Children of Lilith are a ghoul type enemies who pose no threat on their own but can become a source of Souls during certain attacks. If you get hit by the pull + slow you won't be able to get out of the AoE by just running. You need to use an ability to prevent the pull or to remove the slow. Alternatively, you can use a mobility skill or 2-3 Evade charges to get out even while slowed. After dodging, kill the Children before continuing to fight Lilith. Lilith lets out a scream, knocking the player back. After that, Lilith dashes towards the player and shoots a three-pronged fork of shadows at the player, which deals heavy damage. Then she does this dash + fork combo a second time. At the same time, a shadow clone of Lilith is created nearby, which mimics her initial scream and two fork attacks with a 1 second delay. After all 4 forks are shot, Lilith slams the ground near player's position, releasing a massive shadow explosion that deals lethal damage. If Lilith is killed or Staggered during this attack, the shadow clone will continue acting on its own. Since Lilith's death animation is very long, you will receive no rewards for double KO.

During this stage of the fight, Lilith has long cooldowns on her high-damage attacks, giving you plenty of time to damage her and/or apply Stagger. Be ready to dodge Wave of Spikes or Death From Above when they come and you should be able to get through this stage without much trouble. When Lilith's health goes below 70%, she will finish her attack and summon 2 Enforcers. After that, she will continuously use Death From Above as long as at least one of the Enforcers is alive (but no less than 2 times). Each Enforcer will leave behind 2 Volatile Bloods and  6 Health Potion charges upon death. Enforcers themselves deal almost no damage. Your primary focus should be on dodging the Death From Above spam while killing them. Stay at the edge of the arena and let the Enforcers come to you. Be mindful of their pull attack as it can move you into the one-shot attacks from Lilith. If your build is not great at cleaning up Volatile Blood, try to kill the minions one-by-one and kill the Blood in-between. After you kill both minions, the camera returns to the normal zoom level and the second stage of the fight begins.

Stay at the edge of the arena at all times to make dodging easier and slowly work through her HP bar. When Lilith's HP hits 0, the circle created at the start of the fight will disappear and 20 seconds later Echo of Lilith, Mother of Mankind will spawn in the center. Lilith opens up the fight with a semi-fixed sequence of attacks: After that she behaves similar to her first phase. She casts Blood Orb Creation whenever its 15s cooldown is ready and otherwise randomly chooses between Melee Combo, Flight (~20s cooldown), and Shadow Clone (~20s cooldown). During this part of the fight, the only threatening attack Lilith has is Shadow Clone, but with plenty of space to dodge it, you can always run in a big circle and be completely fine. Instead, you should focus at dealing damage and managing Blood Orbs. When the Blood Orb Creation is coming up, move next to (or even inside of) one of the existing Blood Orbs to make sure that their numbers don't increase. Staggering Lilith at this stage is also beneficial as it will destroy some of the Blood Orbs. Alternatively, you can just run to the top of the arena to spawn new Blood Orbs, as this section of the arena will soon be destroyed. This, however, makes the next phase transition very hard to survive, so only do this if you have an Invulnerability skill to help you. After Lilith's HP falls below 85% she will finish her current attack and use Flight (bottom to top). After that, she performs a special move (Lilith can't be Staggered during this time) where she uses her wings to destroy part of the arena. This section overlaps with the safe zone of previously used Flight and players standing on it take minor damage over time. 6 seconds later, the cut-off section crumbles down into the abyss, instantly killing all players standing on it. While the platform is crumbling and for 2 second after, Blood Orbs shoot Souls at the player. 2 Souls are created each second, regardless of the number of currently active Blood Orbs. Souls move at ~133% Movement Speed and home in on their target, but their turn speed is very low, making it possible to sidestep them. Souls deal heavy damage on contact. After the platform is broken, Lilith teleports to the center of arena and uses Ground Slam. Dodging all these attacks can be tricky but it becomes much easier if you can outrun the Souls. Then you just have to run in a large circle, timing it in such a way that you enter the crumbling platform right before the blood on the floor starts burning, and then leave it before it falls down, all without stopping. In this case, you only have to worry about the Souls coming straight at you and you Evade or simply take a step to the side to dodge them. Be aware that the pull from the Ground Slam attack will happen while there's still some Souls out, so you need to make sure that there are no Souls between you and arena's center when it happens (or simply use Unstoppable ability to prevent the pull). The second stage of the fight is no different from the first one, but now Lilith has one more ability to choose from: Ground Slam. The next stage begins when Lilith HP falls below 60% mark. Lilith will once again open up with Flight (bottom left to top right) and then will start breaking off the corner of the platform. Unlike the first time, the safe zone of Flight doesn't perfectly overlap with the crumbling platform and there's some burning blood in the left corner of it. There's nothing different in the way you dodge this attack but it's a bit more difficult because the safe zone and the arena itself is now smaller. After the platform is broken, Lilith will teleport to the center and use Ground Slam. During this stage of the fight, Lilith doesn't gain any new abilities but she gets some upgrades: When Lilith falls below 30% HP, she will break the last corner of the platform, starting with Flight (bottom right to top left), then platform break with all the bells whistles and Souls. As she destroys the last platform, she will cast Shadow Clone. After this, the fight continues but Lilith now has no cooldown on her Flight ability and will often use it twice in a row in opposite directions, forcing you to run from one end of the arena to the other and stand in a tiny safe zone while dodging all the Souls coming for you. On top of that, the arena itself is so small now that you barely have space to dodge her Ground Slam and Shadow Clone attacks. Needless to say, staying alive and dealing damage is extremely difficult so it's recommended to Stagger Lilith either right before or right after the last transition and then deal as much damage as possible to shorten this stage of the fight or even outright kill her. The above description of the fight tells you what happens if you slowly and steadily deal damage to Lilith and she has plenty of time to perform all her special attacks. Things can be very different if your damage is overwhelmingly high and certain parts of the fight can be outright skipped. For example, if you deal 60% of Lilith's HP in one hit at the beginning of the fight, she will go up and then come down to summon Oppressors, and you will never have to fight any Enforcers. Now, most builds can't do that kind of damage but that's where Stagger comes in. Staggering Lilith lets you deal damage to her for 5 seconds uninterrupted and many builds can deal serious damage during that timeframe. If you Stagger her before she gets below 70% HP and then kill her before Stagger ends, you skip the most difficult parts of the first phase. If you manage to build stagger fast enough to Stagger her during the opening sequence of attacks, then you can finish the fight without dodging once. Depending on your damage output you can aim to stagger her at different HP thresholds: To manipulate the moment when Stagger happens you need to adjust the amount of stagger damage your build deals. There's two ways to do that: If you lack the damage to skip parts of the fight within one stagger, you can swap your gear during the fight. For example, you can use to build up Stagger and then switch to offensive gloves and during the Stagger. Reviewed by"

    "content": "Lilith siphons the blood out of the player, dealing unavoidable damage and creating a Volatile Blood beneath their feet. At the same time, 3 Dancing Blood Orbs are created, which orbit the player's position for 5 seconds and then swiftly fly out of the arena. Getting hit by a Dancing Blood Orb deals minor damage and makes the player Vulnerable for 2.5 seconds.  This attack applies a stacking debuff to the player, which increases its damage by 2% per stack. The initial hit applies 2 stacks and each Dancing Blood Orb applies 1 stack on hit. is a common enemy with 1,200,000 HP. If not killed within 12 seconds, Volatile Blood erupts, dealing lethal damage in room-wide AoE. When Lilith is below 40% HP, this attack creates two Volatile Bloods. The initial hit is unavoidable its damage grows over time, so you need to have enough DPS to end the fight before you accumulate too many stacks of this debuff. Try to kill Volatile Blood as soon as possible. If you fail to do it in time, only abilities that make you can save you. Lilith takes 2 steps forward while striking the player twice with her wings. If the player is too far away, Lilith shadowsteps closer to them at the beginning of this attack. This attack can be easily outranged or side-stepped, but its damage is so low that most builds can just facetank it and use it as an opportunity to deal damage. Lilith creates a series of parallel fissures on the ground which explode after a 1 second delay, dealing damage to players standing on top of them. This version is used when Lilith is above 70% HP. Don't stand in the fire if you want to avoid the damage, but, similar to Melee Combo, this ability's damage is low enough for most builds to simply ignore it. Lilith creates two series of parallel fissures on the ground in a criss-cross pattern. Fissures explode after a 1 second delay, dealing damage to players standing on top of them. Standing on the intersection of two fissures deals damage twice. This version is used when Lilith is below 70% HP. The damage this ability stays the same but double-hit can be dangerous to more squishy builds, so don't stand on the intersection of two lines. Lilith turns to face the player and then summons two shadow clones of herself. After a brief delay, Lilith and her clones jump backwards while launching forward a wide wave of demonic spikes that deals lethal damage on contact. The easiest way to dodge this attack is to simply move behind Lilith while she is preparing the wave. If Lilith's back is to the edge of the arena and you can't stand behind her, you need to run backwards and to the side to get out of the way. In some cases the wave can be aimed directly through the arena's center, making it impossible to dodge without leaving the circle. To prevent this from happening, never stand between Lilith and the center of the arena when you both are close to the edge. Lilith leaps upward, briefly leaving the arena. After a 1.2 second delay, 3 warning markers are created on the ground: one directly next to the player and two more to the sides and slightly back. One second later, Lilith's shadow clones come crashing down and launch 3 narrow waves of demonic spikes from the position of the markers. Finally, Lilith herself comes down, launching the 4th wave down the middle lane from further back. This version is available at all times. As soon as you see Lilith crouch before her jump, start moving to the edge of the arena. If you get there fast enough, all the launching spots of the waves will be inside the circle. Then all you have to do is run to the opposite side until you get behind the 4th warning marker. This way you are never in a path of any waves and you are also right next to the Lilith's landing spot, ready to deal damage. If you fail to get to the edge of the arena in time, the safe areas may land outside the circle. In that case you have to dodge the attack the hard way. Move to the side of the first marker to let the wave pass you by. As soon as it passes, immediately get behind it to avoid the incoming side wave. Again, as soon as side wave passes, go behind it again to avoid the final wave coming down the middle. Keep in mind that the hitbox of the waves is slightly in front of them (which is further exacerbated by your latency), meaning that you will get hit before the wave even touches you. On the bright side, that also means that back side of the wave is quite safe: if you approach a wave from behind you can literally stand on top of the spikes without taking damage. Lilith leaps upward, briefly leaving the arena. After a 1.2 second delay, 3 warning markers are created on the ground: one directly next to the player and two more to the sides and far behind. One second later, Lilith's shadow clones come crashing down and launch 3 narrow waves of demonic spikes from the position of the markers. Finally Lilith herself comes down, launching the 4th wave down the middle lane from further back. This version is available when Lilith is below 70% HP. The exact same strategy can be used for this version: run to the edge, wait for marker, run to to opposite side to get behind the 4th wave. Since you always stay in the middle lane you don't have to worry about side waves no matter what direction they go. If you fail to get to the edge of the arena in time, you need to dodge differently. Get behind the first marker and then run behind the wave as closely as you can. When the side waves pass by, get out of the middle to avoid the incoming last wave. If the first marker is at the edge of the circle and you can't get behind it, simply run backwards and to the side to get behind one of the side waves. In this version, there are 3 waves going along the sides of a triangle in clockwise direction. Lilith herself comes down in the center of the triangle, dealing lethal damage in large circular AoE. This version is available when Lilith is below 40% HP. The general method of dodging remains the same: you need to get to one side of the circle so that the attack is aimed off-center, and then quickly dash to the safe area on the opposite site. Keep in mind that that the waves continue traveling past the vertices of the triangle so the to be safe you need to be completely outside it. Unlike the previous two versions, this attack leaves you with less time to react since you need to get out of the central AoE quickly. If you fail to get to the edge of the arena in time, there might be no safe zones at all and then only Invulnerability can save you. This version also has only 3 first waves from the second version. Instead of launching 4th wave down the middle, Lilith comes down directly next to the player, dealing lethal damage in large circular AoE. This version is available when Lilith is below 40% HP. The general method of dodging remains the same: you need to get to one side of the circle so that the attack is aimed off-center, and then quickly dash to the safe area on the opposite site. If you stay in the middle lane while doing that, don't forget about incoming wave that will come a few seconds later. Move left or right when the side waves pass you. If you fail to get to the edge of the arena in time, there might be no safe zones at all and then only Invulnerability can save you. Lilith plunges her tail into the ground while siphoning blood out of the player at the same time, dealing unavoidable damage and creating 8 Dancing Blood Orbs going around the player in two concentric circles. After a brief delay an explosion of blood goes off next to the player dealing damage and creating a new Blood Orb in the center. All previously created Blood Orbs caught in the explosion are destroyed. Dancing Blood Orbs deal minor damage and make the player Vulnerable for 2.5 seconds upon impact. After orbiting the player's original position for 5 seconds, Dancing Blood Orbs swiftly fly out of the arena. In this phase, Blood Orbs are not enemies but obstacles on the map. Stepping into a Blood Orb deals low damage over time to the player and slows them. During certain attacks in this phase, Blood Orbs create deadly Red Souls that chase down the player. If Lilith is Staggered, all Blood Orbs except two (selected at random) are destroyed. This attack applies a stacking debuff to the player, which increases its damage by 2% per stack. The initial hit and the blood explosion apply 2 stacks and each Dancing Blood Orb applies 1 stack on hit. The initial hit is unavoidable. Its damage grows over time, so you need to have enough DPS to end the fight before you accumulate too many stacks of the debuff. The explosion deals high damage but it's easy to dodge with Evade if you remember it's coming. This version of the attack does the same initial damage and creates Dancing Blood Orbs, but instead of creating a single blood explosion next to the player 4 explosions happen in different corners of the arena and 4 Blood Orbs are created. This version is used at the beginning of the second phase when there are no active Blood Orbs on the arena. It can be skipped completely if you manage to take Lilith below 85% health before she spawns them, making this entire phase significantly easier. Lilith strikes the player 1-3 times with her tail. Similar to first phase, the damage of this attack is so low that most builds can just facetank it and use it as an opportunity to deal damage. Lilith flies up into the air and pulls all enemies towards herself while slowing them for 3 seconds. At the same time, she summons 4-6 (depending on her HP) Children of Lilith. After a 2 second delay, Lilith slams down onto the ground, dealing lethal damage in a large circle. Children of Lilith are a ghoul type enemies who pose no threat on their own but can become a source of Souls during certain attacks. If you get hit by the pull + slow you won't be able to get out of the AoE by just running. You need to use an ability to prevent the pull or to remove the slow. Alternatively, you can use a mobility skill or 2-3 Evade charges to get out even while slowed. After dodging, kill the Children before continuing to fight Lilith. Lilith lets out a scream, knocking the player back. After that, Lilith dashes towards the player and shoots a three-pronged fork of shadows at the player, which deals heavy damage. Then she does this dash + fork combo a second time. At the same time, a shadow clone of Lilith is created nearby, which mimics her initial scream and two fork attacks with a 1 second delay. After all 4 forks are shot, Lilith slams the ground near player's position, releasing a massive shadow explosion that deals lethal damage. If Lilith is killed or Staggered during this attack, the shadow clone will continue acting on its own. Since Lilith's death animation is very long, you will receive no rewards for double KO. Very tanky builds can survive a single hit by a fork, but most have to dodge this attack entirely. To do that, move away from Lilith and run in a large circle. Each fork's middle prong is always aimed directly at you, so you will always dodge it as long as you move laterally. In doing so, you risk running into one of the side prongs, so you need to either be far enough away from Lilith or slow down a bit after you dodge the middle one. When Lilith raises her wings before the final part of the attack, move quickly to the opposite side of the arena to avoid the explosion. Lilith flies up and leaves the arena. After a brief delay, she comes back flying across the entire battlefield, covering the ground behind her in a thick layer of cursed blood. After a 3 second delay, the blood ignites, dealing lethal damage to all enemies caught in it for the next 2 seconds. There's always a safe zone at the side of the arena where Lilith finishes her flight. This attack is trivial to dodge on it's own and only becomes dangerous when combined with Souls chasing down the player. Remember that no damage is done until the blood catches fire, so you don't need to rush into the safe zone immediately. After player enters the arena, Lilith will drop down in the center, knocking the player back and creating a Circle of Doom that limits the size of the playable area. Stepping outside of the circle will deal extremely high damage over time to the player. The fight always starts with the fixed sequence of attacks: After that she will select one of 5 attacks available to her: Lilith will always prioritize Blood Orb Creation if it's not on cooldown. She will never do Melee Combo more than twice in a row. Otherwise the attacks are selected at random. During this stage of the fight, Lilith has long cooldowns on her high-damage attacks, giving you plenty of time to damage her and/or apply Stagger. Be ready to dodge Wave of Spikes or Death From Above when they come and you should be able to get through this stage without much trouble. When Lilith's health goes below 70%, she will finish her attack and summon 2 Enforcers. After that, she will continuously use Death From Above as long as at least one of the Enforcers is alive (but no less than 2 times). Each Enforcer will leave behind 2 Volatile Bloods and  6 Health Potion charges upon death. Enforcers themselves deal almost no damage. Your primary focus should be on dodging the Death From Above spam while killing them. Stay at the edge of the arena and let the Enforcers come to you. Be mindful of their pull attack as it can move you into the one-shot attacks from Lilith. If your build is not great at cleaning up Volatile Blood, try to kill the minions one-by-one and kill the Blood in-between. After you kill both minions, the camera returns to the normal zoom level and the second stage of the fight begins. Lilith's abilities are upgraded: Her attacks, in general, will follow this pattern: Your best strategy is to focus on dodging during steps 1-3 and doing damage during step 4. Since her Blood Orb Creation now has reduced cooldown and still has highest priority, the attack in step 2 will often be Blood Orb Creation. It's recommended to focus on dodging the incoming Death From Above first and killing Volatile Bloods second. Since Volatile Bloods take 12 seconds to detonate, you have plenty of time to kill it without the threat of a one-shot hanging over you. When Lilith's health goes below 40%, she will finish her attack and summon 3 Oppressors. Same as the first minion phase, she will spam use Death From Above as long as her minions live. This phase is not very different from the first one. Now there are 3 minions instead of 2 but they pose little threat and all the danger is coming from now further upgraded Death From Above. Our strategy stays the same: focus on dodging first and killing second. After the minions die, the fight continues with more improvements to Lilith's attacks: During this stage Lilith will simply use Death From Above after every 2-3 attacks giving you little time to deal damage. Stay at the edge of the arena at all times to make dodging easier and slowly work through her HP bar. When Lilith's HP hits 0, the circle created at the start of the fight will disappear and 20 seconds later Echo of Lilith, Mother of Mankind will spawn in the center. Lilith opens up the fight with a semi-fixed sequence of attacks: After that she behaves similar to her first phase. She casts Blood Orb Creation whenever its 15s cooldown is ready and otherwise randomly chooses between Melee Combo, Flight (~20s cooldown), and Shadow Clone (~20s cooldown). During this part of the fight, the only threatening attack Lilith has is Shadow Clone, but with plenty of space to dodge it, you can always run in a big circle and be completely fine. Instead, you should focus at dealing damage and managing Blood Orbs. When the Blood Orb Creation is coming up, move next to (or even inside of) one of the existing Blood Orbs to make sure that their numbers don't increase. Staggering Lilith at this stage is also beneficial as it will destroy some of the Blood Orbs. Alternatively, you can just run to the top of the arena to spawn new Blood Orbs, as this section of the arena will soon be destroyed. This, however, makes the next phase transition very hard to survive, so only do this if you have an Invulnerability skill to help you. After Lilith's HP falls below 85% she will finish her current attack and use Flight (bottom to top). After that, she performs a special move (Lilith can't be Staggered during this time) where she uses her wings to destroy part of the arena. This section overlaps with the safe zone of previously used Flight and players standing on it take minor damage over time. 6 seconds later, the cut-off section crumbles down into the abyss, instantly killing all players standing on it. While the platform is crumbling and for 2 second after, Blood Orbs shoot Souls at the player. 2 Souls are created each second, regardless of the number of currently active Blood Orbs. Souls move at ~133% Movement Speed and home in on their target, but their turn speed is very low, making it possible to sidestep them. Souls deal heavy damage on contact.

Lilith plunges her tail into the ground while siphoning blood out of the player at the same time, dealing unavoidable damage and creating 8 Dancing Blood Orbs going around the player in two concentric circles. After a brief delay an explosion of blood goes off next to the player dealing damage and creating a new Blood Orb in the center. All previously created Blood Orbs caught in the explosion are destroyed. Dancing Blood Orbs deal minor damage and make the player Vulnerable for 2.5 seconds upon impact. After orbiting the player's original position for 5 seconds, Dancing Blood Orbs swiftly fly out of the arena. In this phase, Blood Orbs are not enemies but obstacles on the map. Stepping into a Blood Orb deals low damage over time to the player and slows them. During certain attacks in this phase, Blood Orbs create deadly Red Souls that chase down the player. If Lilith is Staggered, all Blood Orbs except two (selected at random) are destroyed. This attack applies a stacking debuff to the player, which increases its damage by 2% per stack. The initial hit and the blood explosion apply 2 stacks and each Dancing Blood Orb applies 1 stack on hit. The initial hit is unavoidable. Its damage grows over time, so you need to have enough DPS to end the fight before you accumulate too many stacks of the debuff. The explosion deals high damage but it's easy to dodge with Evade if you remember it's coming. This version of the attack does the same initial damage and creates Dancing Blood Orbs, but instead of creating a single blood explosion next to the player 4 explosions happen in different corners of the arena and 4 Blood Orbs are created. This version is used at the beginning of the second phase when there are no active Blood Orbs on the arena. It can be skipped completely if you manage to take Lilith below 85% health before she spawns them, making this entire phase significantly easier. Lilith strikes the player 1-3 times with her tail. Similar to first phase, the damage of this attack is so low that most builds can just facetank it and use it as an opportunity to deal damage. Lilith flies up into the air and pulls all enemies towards herself while slowing them for 3 seconds. At the same time, she summons 4-6 (depending on her HP) Children of Lilith. After a 2 second delay, Lilith slams down onto the ground, dealing lethal damage in a large circle. Children of Lilith are a ghoul type enemies who pose no threat on their own but can become a source of Souls during certain attacks. If you get hit by the pull + slow you won't be able to get out of the AoE by just running. You need to use an ability to prevent the pull or to remove the slow. Alternatively, you can use a mobility skill or 2-3 Evade charges to get out even while slowed. After dodging, kill the Children before continuing to fight Lilith. Lilith lets out a scream, knocking the player back. After that, Lilith dashes towards the player and shoots a three-pronged fork of shadows at the player, which deals heavy damage. Then she does this dash + fork combo a second time. At the same time, a shadow clone of Lilith is created nearby, which mimics her initial scream and two fork attacks with a 1 second delay. After all 4 forks are shot, Lilith slams the ground near player's position, releasing a massive shadow explosion that deals lethal damage. If Lilith is killed or Staggered during this attack, the shadow clone will continue acting on its own. Since Lilith's death animation is very long, you will receive no rewards for double KO. Very tanky builds can survive a single hit by a fork, but most have to dodge this attack entirely. To do that, move away from Lilith and run in a large circle. Each fork's middle prong is always aimed directly at you, so you will always dodge it as long as you move laterally. In doing so, you risk running into one of the side prongs, so you need to either be far enough away from Lilith or slow down a bit after you dodge the middle one. When Lilith raises her wings before the final part of the attack, move quickly to the opposite side of the arena to avoid the explosion. Lilith flies up and leaves the arena. After a brief delay, she comes back flying across the entire battlefield, covering the ground behind her in a thick layer of cursed blood. After a 3 second delay, the blood ignites, dealing lethal damage to all enemies caught in it for the next 2 seconds. There's always a safe zone at the side of the arena where Lilith finishes her flight. This attack is trivial to dodge on it's own and only becomes dangerous when combined with Souls chasing down the player. Remember that no damage is done until the blood catches fire, so you don't need to rush into the safe zone immediately. After player enters the arena, Lilith will drop down in the center, knocking the player back and creating a Circle of Doom that limits the size of the playable area. Stepping outside of the circle will deal extremely high damage over time to the player. The fight always starts with the fixed sequence of attacks: After that she will select one of 5 attacks available to her: Lilith will always prioritize Blood Orb Creation if it's not on cooldown. She will never do Melee Combo more than twice in a row. Otherwise the attacks are selected at random. During this stage of the fight, Lilith has long cooldowns on her high-damage attacks, giving you plenty of time to damage her and/or apply Stagger. Be ready to dodge Wave of Spikes or Death From Above when they come and you should be able to get through this stage without much trouble. When Lilith's health goes below 70%, she will finish her attack and summon 2 Enforcers. After that, she will continuously use Death From Above as long as at least one of the Enforcers is alive (but no less than 2 times). Each Enforcer will leave behind 2 Volatile Bloods and  6 Health Potion charges upon death. Enforcers themselves deal almost no damage. Your primary focus should be on dodging the Death From Above spam while killing them. Stay at the edge of the arena and let the Enforcers come to you. Be mindful of their pull attack as it can move you into the one-shot attacks from Lilith. If your build is not great at cleaning up Volatile Blood, try to kill the minions one-by-one and kill the Blood in-between. After you kill both minions, the camera returns to the normal zoom level and the second stage of the fight begins. Lilith's abilities are upgraded: Her attacks, in general, will follow this pattern: Your best strategy is to focus on dodging during steps 1-3 and doing damage during step 4. Since her Blood Orb Creation now has reduced cooldown and still has highest priority, the attack in step 2 will often be Blood Orb Creation. It's recommended to focus on dodging the incoming Death From Above first and killing Volatile Bloods second. Since Volatile Bloods take 12 seconds to detonate, you have plenty of time to kill it without the threat of a one-shot hanging over you. When Lilith's health goes below 40%, she will finish her attack and summon 3 Oppressors. Same as the first minion phase, she will spam use Death From Above as long as her minions live. This phase is not very different from the first one. Now there are 3 minions instead of 2 but they pose little threat and all the danger is coming from now further upgraded Death From Above. Our strategy stays the same: focus on dodging first and killing second. After the minions die, the fight continues with more improvements to Lilith's attacks: During this stage Lilith will simply use Death From Above after every 2-3 attacks giving you little time to deal damage. Stay at the edge of the arena at all times to make dodging easier and slowly work through her HP bar."

    "content": "When Lilith is below 40% HP, this attack creates two Volatile Bloods. The initial hit is unavoidable its damage grows over time, so you need to have enough DPS to end the fight before you accumulate too many stacks of this debuff. Try to kill Volatile Blood as soon as possible. If you fail to do it in time, only abilities that make you can save you. Lilith takes 2 steps forward while striking the player twice with her wings. If the player is too far away, Lilith shadowsteps closer to them at the beginning of this attack. This attack can be easily outranged or side-stepped, but its damage is so low that most builds can just facetank it and use it as an opportunity to deal damage. Lilith creates a series of parallel fissures on the ground which explode after a 1 second delay, dealing damage to players standing on top of them. This version is used when Lilith is above 70% HP. Don't stand in the fire if you want to avoid the damage, but, similar to Melee Combo, this ability's damage is low enough for most builds to simply ignore it. Lilith creates two series of parallel fissures on the ground in a criss-cross pattern. Fissures explode after a 1 second delay, dealing damage to players standing on top of them. Standing on the intersection of two fissures deals damage twice. This version is used when Lilith is below 70% HP. The damage this ability stays the same but double-hit can be dangerous to more squishy builds, so don't stand on the intersection of two lines. Lilith turns to face the player and then summons two shadow clones of herself. After a brief delay, Lilith and her clones jump backwards while launching forward a wide wave of demonic spikes that deals lethal damage on contact. The easiest way to dodge this attack is to simply move behind Lilith while she is preparing the wave. If Lilith's back is to the edge of the arena and you can't stand behind her, you need to run backwards and to the side to get out of the way. In some cases the wave can be aimed directly through the arena's center, making it impossible to dodge without leaving the circle. To prevent this from happening, never stand between Lilith and the center of the arena when you both are close to the edge. Lilith leaps upward, briefly leaving the arena. After a 1.2 second delay, 3 warning markers are created on the ground: one directly next to the player and two more to the sides and slightly back. One second later, Lilith's shadow clones come crashing down and launch 3 narrow waves of demonic spikes from the position of the markers. Finally, Lilith herself comes down, launching the 4th wave down the middle lane from further back. This version is available at all times. As soon as you see Lilith crouch before her jump, start moving to the edge of the arena. If you get there fast enough, all the launching spots of the waves will be inside the circle. Then all you have to do is run to the opposite side until you get behind the 4th warning marker. This way you are never in a path of any waves and you are also right next to the Lilith's landing spot, ready to deal damage. If you fail to get to the edge of the arena in time, the safe areas may land outside the circle. In that case you have to dodge the attack the hard way. Move to the side of the first marker to let the wave pass you by. As soon as it passes, immediately get behind it to avoid the incoming side wave. Again, as soon as side wave passes, go behind it again to avoid the final wave coming down the middle. Keep in mind that the hitbox of the waves is slightly in front of them (which is further exacerbated by your latency), meaning that you will get hit before the wave even touches you. On the bright side, that also means that back side of the wave is quite safe: if you approach a wave from behind you can literally stand on top of the spikes without taking damage. Lilith leaps upward, briefly leaving the arena. After a 1.2 second delay, 3 warning markers are created on the ground: one directly next to the player and two more to the sides and far behind. One second later, Lilith's shadow clones come crashing down and launch 3 narrow waves of demonic spikes from the position of the markers. Finally Lilith herself comes down, launching the 4th wave down the middle lane from further back. This version is available when Lilith is below 70% HP. The exact same strategy can be used for this version: run to the edge, wait for marker, run to to opposite side to get behind the 4th wave. Since you always stay in the middle lane you don't have to worry about side waves no matter what direction they go. If you fail to get to the edge of the arena in time, you need to dodge differently. Get behind the first marker and then run behind the wave as closely as you can. When the side waves pass by, get out of the middle to avoid the incoming last wave. If the first marker is at the edge of the circle and you can't get behind it, simply run backwards and to the side to get behind one of the side waves. In this version, there are 3 waves going along the sides of a triangle in clockwise direction. Lilith herself comes down in the center of the triangle, dealing lethal damage in large circular AoE. This version is available when Lilith is below 40% HP. The general method of dodging remains the same: you need to get to one side of the circle so that the attack is aimed off-center, and then quickly dash to the safe area on the opposite site. Keep in mind that that the waves continue traveling past the vertices of the triangle so the to be safe you need to be completely outside it. Unlike the previous two versions, this attack leaves you with less time to react since you need to get out of the central AoE quickly. If you fail to get to the edge of the arena in time, there might be no safe zones at all and then only Invulnerability can save you. This version also has only 3 first waves from the second version. Instead of launching 4th wave down the middle, Lilith comes down directly next to the player, dealing lethal damage in large circular AoE. This version is available when Lilith is below 40% HP. The general method of dodging remains the same: you need to get to one side of the circle so that the attack is aimed off-center, and then quickly dash to the safe area on the opposite site. If you stay in the middle lane while doing that, don't forget about incoming wave that will come a few seconds later. Move left or right when the side waves pass you. If you fail to get to the edge of the arena in time, there might be no safe zones at all and then only Invulnerability can save you. Lilith plunges her tail into the ground while siphoning blood out of the player at the same time, dealing unavoidable damage and creating 8 Dancing Blood Orbs going around the player in two concentric circles. After a brief delay an explosion of blood goes off next to the player dealing damage and creating a new Blood Orb in the center. All previously created Blood Orbs caught in the explosion are destroyed. Dancing Blood Orbs deal minor damage and make the player Vulnerable for 2.5 seconds upon impact. After orbiting the player's original position for 5 seconds, Dancing Blood Orbs swiftly fly out of the arena. In this phase, Blood Orbs are not enemies but obstacles on the map. Stepping into a Blood Orb deals low damage over time to the player and slows them. During certain attacks in this phase, Blood Orbs create deadly Red Souls that chase down the player. If Lilith is Staggered, all Blood Orbs except two (selected at random) are destroyed. This attack applies a stacking debuff to the player, which increases its damage by 2% per stack. The initial hit and the blood explosion apply 2 stacks and each Dancing Blood Orb applies 1 stack on hit. The initial hit is unavoidable. Its damage grows over time, so you need to have enough DPS to end the fight before you accumulate too many stacks of the debuff. The explosion deals high damage but it's easy to dodge with Evade if you remember it's coming. This version of the attack does the same initial damage and creates Dancing Blood Orbs, but instead of creating a single blood explosion next to the player 4 explosions happen in different corners of the arena and 4 Blood Orbs are created. This version is used at the beginning of the second phase when there are no active Blood Orbs on the arena. It can be skipped completely if you manage to take Lilith below 85% health before she spawns them, making this entire phase significantly easier. Lilith strikes the player 1-3 times with her tail.

Lilith flies up into the air and pulls all enemies towards herself while slowing them for 3 seconds. At the same time, she summons 4-6 (depending on her HP) Children of Lilith. After a 2 second delay, Lilith slams down onto the ground, dealing lethal damage in a large circle.

Alternatively, you can use a mobility skill or 2-3 Evade charges to get out even while slowed. After dodging, kill the Children before continuing to fight Lilith. Lilith lets out a scream, knocking the player back. After that, Lilith dashes towards the player and shoots a three-pronged fork of shadows at the player, which deals heavy damage. Then she does this dash + fork combo a second time. At the same time, a shadow clone of Lilith is created nearby, which mimics her initial scream and two fork attacks with a 1 second delay. After all 4 forks are shot, Lilith slams the ground near player's position, releasing a massive shadow explosion that deals lethal damage. If Lilith is killed or Staggered during this attack, the shadow clone will continue acting on its own. Since Lilith's death animation is very long, you will receive no rewards for double KO. Very tanky builds can survive a single hit by a fork, but most have to dodge this attack entirely. To do that, move away from Lilith and run in a large circle. Each fork's middle prong is always aimed directly at you, so you will always dodge it as long as you move laterally. In doing so, you risk running into one of the side prongs, so you need to either be far enough away from Lilith or slow down a bit after you dodge the middle one. When Lilith raises her wings before the final part of the attack, move quickly to the opposite side of the arena to avoid the explosion. Lilith flies up and leaves the arena.

When Lilith's health goes below 70%, she will finish her attack and summon 2 Enforcers. After that, she will continuously use Death From Above as long as at least one of the Enforcers is alive (but no less than 2 times). Each Enforcer will leave behind 2 Volatile Bloods and  6 Health Potion charges upon death. Enforcers themselves deal almost no damage. Your primary focus should be on dodging the Death From Above spam while killing them. Stay at the edge of the arena and let the Enforcers come to you. Be mindful of their pull attack as it can move you into the one-shot attacks from Lilith. If your build is not great at cleaning up Volatile Blood, try to kill the minions one-by-one and kill the Blood in-between. After you kill both minions, the camera returns to the normal zoom level and the second stage of the fight begins. Lilith's abilities are upgraded: Her attacks, in general, will follow this pattern: Your best strategy is to focus on dodging during steps 1-3 and doing damage during step 4. Since her Blood Orb Creation now has reduced cooldown and still has highest priority, the attack in step 2 will often be Blood Orb Creation. It's recommended to focus on dodging the incoming Death From Above first and killing Volatile Bloods second.

This phase is not very different from the first one. Now there are 3 minions instead of 2 but they pose little threat and all the danger is coming from now further upgraded Death From Above. Our strategy stays the same: focus on dodging first and killing second. After the minions die, the fight continues with more improvements to Lilith's attacks: During this stage Lilith will simply use Death From Above after every 2-3 attacks giving you little time to deal damage. Stay at the edge of the arena at all times to make dodging easier and slowly work through her HP bar. When Lilith's HP hits 0, the circle created at the start of the fight will disappear and 20 seconds later Echo of Lilith, Mother of Mankind will spawn in the center. Lilith opens up the fight with a semi-fixed sequence of attacks: After that she behaves similar to her first phase. She casts Blood Orb Creation whenever its 15s cooldown is ready and otherwise randomly chooses between Melee Combo, Flight (~20s cooldown), and Shadow Clone (~20s cooldown). During this part of the fight, the only threatening attack Lilith has is Shadow Clone, but with plenty of space to dodge it, you can always run in a big circle and be completely fine. Instead, you should focus at dealing damage and managing Blood Orbs. When the Blood Orb Creation is coming up, move next to (or even inside of) one of the existing Blood Orbs to make sure that their numbers don't increase. Staggering Lilith at this stage is also beneficial as it will destroy some of the Blood Orbs. Alternatively, you can just run to the top of the arena to spawn new Blood Orbs, as this section of the arena will soon be destroyed. This, however, makes the next phase transition very hard to survive, so only do this if you have an Invulnerability skill to help you. After Lilith's HP falls below 85% she will finish her current attack and use Flight (bottom to top). After that, she performs a special move (Lilith can't be Staggered during this time) where she uses her wings to destroy part of the arena. This section overlaps with the safe zone of previously used Flight and players standing on it take minor damage over time. 6 seconds later, the cut-off section crumbles down into the abyss, instantly killing all players standing on it. While the platform is crumbling and for 2 second after, Blood Orbs shoot Souls at the player. 2 Souls are created each second, regardless of the number of currently active Blood Orbs. Souls move at ~133% Movement Speed and home in on their target, but their turn speed is very low, making it possible to sidestep them. Souls deal heavy damage on contact. After the platform is broken, Lilith teleports to the center of arena and uses Ground Slam. Dodging all these attacks can be tricky but it becomes much easier if you can outrun the Souls. Then you just have to run in a large circle, timing it in such a way that you enter the crumbling platform right before the blood on the floor starts burning, and then leave it before it falls down, all without stopping. In this case, you only have to worry about the Souls coming straight at you and you Evade or simply take a step to the side to dodge them. Be aware that the pull from the Ground Slam attack will happen while there's still some Souls out, so you need to make sure that there are no Souls between you and arena's center when it happens (or simply use Unstoppable ability to prevent the pull). The second stage of the fight is no different from the first one, but now Lilith has one more ability to choose from: Ground Slam. The next stage begins when Lilith HP falls below 60% mark. Lilith will once again open up with Flight (bottom left to top right) and then will start breaking off the corner of the platform. Unlike the first time, the safe zone of Flight doesn't perfectly overlap with the crumbling platform and there's some burning blood in the left corner of it. There's nothing different in the way you dodge this attack but it's a bit more difficult because the safe zone and the arena itself is now smaller. After the platform is broken, Lilith will teleport to the center and use Ground Slam. During this stage of the fight, Lilith doesn't gain any new abilities but she gets some upgrades: When Lilith falls below 30% HP, she will break the last corner of the platform, starting with Flight (bottom right to top left), then platform break with all the bells whistles and Souls. As she destroys the last platform, she will cast Shadow Clone. After this, the fight continues but Lilith now has no cooldown on her Flight ability and will often use it twice in a row in opposite directions, forcing you to run from one end of the arena to the other and stand in a tiny safe zone while dodging all the Souls coming for you. On top of that, the arena itself is so small now that you barely have space to dodge her Ground Slam and Shadow Clone attacks. Needless to say, staying alive and dealing damage is extremely difficult so it's recommended to Stagger Lilith either right before or right after the last transition and then deal as much damage as possible to shorten this stage of the fight or even outright kill her. The above description of the fight tells you what happens if you slowly and steadily deal damage to Lilith and she has plenty of time to perform all her special attacks. Things can be very different if your damage is overwhelmingly high and certain parts of the fight can be outright skipped. For example, if you deal 60% of Lilith's HP in one hit at the beginning of the fight, she will go up and then come down to summon Oppressors, and you will never have to fight any Enforcers. Now, most builds can't do that kind of damage but that's where Stagger comes in. Staggering Lilith lets you deal damage to her for 5 seconds uninterrupted and many builds can deal serious damage during that timeframe. If you Stagger her before she gets below 70% HP and then kill her before Stagger ends, you skip the most difficult parts of the first phase. If you manage to build stagger fast enough to Stagger her during the opening sequence of attacks, then you can finish the fight without dodging once. Depending on your damage output you can aim to stagger her at different HP thresholds: To manipulate the moment when Stagger happens you need to adjust the amount of stagger damage your build deals. There's two ways to do that: If you lack the damage to skip parts of the fight within one stagger, you can swap your gear during the fight. For example, you can use to build up Stagger and then switch to offensive gloves and during the Stagger. Reviewed by"

In this version, there are 3 waves going along the sides of a triangle in clockwise direction. Lilith herself comes down in the center of the triangle, dealing lethal damage in large circular AoE. This version is available when Lilith is below 40% HP.

Lilith plunges her tail into the ground while siphoning blood out of the player at the same time, dealing unavoidable damage and creating 8 Dancing Blood Orbs going around the player in two concentric circles. After a brief delay an explosion of blood goes off next to the player dealing damage and creating a new Blood Orb in the center. All previously created Blood Orbs caught in the explosion are destroyed. Dancing Blood Orbs deal minor damage and make the player Vulnerable for 2.5 seconds upon impact. After orbiting the player's original position for 5 seconds, Dancing Blood Orbs swiftly fly out of the arena. In this phase, Blood Orbs are not enemies but obstacles on the map. Stepping into a Blood Orb deals low damage over time to the player and slows them. During certain attacks in this phase, Blood Orbs create deadly Red Souls that chase down the player. If Lilith is Staggered, all Blood Orbs except two (selected at random) are destroyed. This attack applies a stacking debuff to the player, which increases its damage by 2% per stack. The initial hit and the blood explosion apply 2 stacks and each Dancing Blood Orb applies 1 stack on hit. The initial hit is unavoidable. Its damage grows over time, so you need to have enough DPS to end the fight before you accumulate too many stacks of the debuff. The explosion deals high damage but it's easy to dodge with Evade if you remember it's coming. This version of the attack does the same initial damage and creates Dancing Blood Orbs, but instead of creating a single blood explosion next to the player 4 explosions happen in different corners of the arena and 4 Blood Orbs are created. This version is used at the beginning of the second phase when there are no active Blood Orbs on the arena. It can be skipped completely if you manage to take Lilith below 85% health before she spawns them, making this entire phase significantly easier. Lilith strikes the player 1-3 times with her tail. Similar to first phase, the damage of this attack is so low that most builds can just facetank it and use it as an opportunity to deal damage. Lilith flies up into the air and pulls all enemies towards herself while slowing them for 3 seconds. At the same time, she summons 4-6 (depending on her HP) Children of Lilith. After a 2 second delay, Lilith slams down onto the ground, dealing lethal damage in a large circle. Children of Lilith are a ghoul type enemies who pose no threat on their own but can become a source of Souls during certain attacks. If you get hit by the pull + slow you won't be able to get out of the AoE by just running. You need to use an ability to prevent the pull or to remove the slow. Alternatively, you can use a mobility skill or 2-3 Evade charges to get out even while slowed. After dodging, kill the Children before continuing to fight Lilith. Lilith lets out a scream, knocking the player back. After that, Lilith dashes towards the player and shoots a three-pronged fork of shadows at the player, which deals heavy damage. Then she does this dash + fork combo a second time. At the same time, a shadow clone of Lilith is created nearby, which mimics her initial scream and two fork attacks with a 1 second delay. After all 4 forks are shot, Lilith slams the ground near player's position, releasing a massive shadow explosion that deals lethal damage. If Lilith is killed or Staggered during this attack, the shadow clone will continue acting on its own. Since Lilith's death animation is very long, you will receive no rewards for double KO. Very tanky builds can survive a single hit by a fork, but most have to dodge this attack entirely. To do that, move away from Lilith and run in a large circle. Each fork's middle prong is always aimed directly at you, so you will always dodge it as long as you move laterally. In doing so, you risk running into one of the side prongs, so you need to either be far enough away from Lilith or slow down a bit after you dodge the middle one. When Lilith raises her wings before the final part of the attack, move quickly to the opposite side of the arena to avoid the explosion. Lilith flies up and leaves the arena. After a brief delay, she comes back flying across the entire battlefield, covering the ground behind her in a thick layer of cursed blood. After a 3 second delay, the blood ignites, dealing lethal damage to all enemies caught in it for the next 2 seconds. There's always a safe zone at the side of the arena where Lilith finishes her flight. This attack is trivial to dodge on it's own and only becomes dangerous when combined with Souls chasing down the player. Remember that no damage is done until the blood catches fire, so you don't need to rush into the safe zone immediately. After player enters the arena, Lilith will drop down in the center, knocking the player back and creating a Circle of Doom that limits the size of the playable area. Stepping outside of the circle will deal extremely high damage over time to the player. The fight always starts with the fixed sequence of attacks: After that she will select one of 5 attacks available to her: Lilith will always prioritize Blood Orb Creation if it's not on cooldown. She will never do Melee Combo more than twice in a row. Otherwise the attacks are selected at random. During this stage of the fight, Lilith has long cooldowns on her high-damage attacks, giving you plenty of time to damage her and/or apply Stagger. Be ready to dodge Wave of Spikes or Death From Above when they come and you should be able to get through this stage without much trouble. When Lilith's health goes below 70%, she will finish her attack and summon 2 Enforcers. After that, she will continuously use Death From Above as long as at least one of the Enforcers is alive (but no less than 2 times). Each Enforcer will leave behind 2 Volatile Bloods and  6 Health Potion charges upon death. Enforcers themselves deal almost no damage. Your primary focus should be on dodging the Death From Above spam while killing them. Stay at the edge of the arena and let the Enforcers come to you. Be mindful of their pull attack as it can move you into the one-shot attacks from Lilith. If your build is not great at cleaning up Volatile Blood, try to kill the minions one-by-one and kill the Blood in-between. After you kill both minions, the camera returns to the normal zoom level and the second stage of the fight begins. Lilith's abilities are upgraded: Her attacks, in general, will follow this pattern: Your best strategy is to focus on dodging during steps 1-3 and doing damage during step 4. Since her Blood Orb Creation now has reduced cooldown and still has highest priority, the attack in step 2 will often be Blood Orb Creation. It's recommended to focus on dodging the incoming Death From Above first and killing Volatile Bloods second. Since Volatile Bloods take 12 seconds to detonate, you have plenty of time to kill it without the threat of a one-shot hanging over you. When Lilith's health goes below 40%, she will finish her attack and summon 3 Oppressors. Same as the first minion phase, she will spam use Death From Above as long as her minions live. This phase is not very different from the first one. Now there are 3 minions instead of 2 but they pose little threat and all the danger is coming from now further upgraded Death From Above. Our strategy stays the same: focus on dodging first and killing second. After the minions die, the fight continues with more improvements to Lilith's attacks: During this stage Lilith will simply use Death From Above after every 2-3 attacks giving you little time to deal damage. Stay at the edge of the arena at all times to make dodging easier and slowly work through her HP bar. When Lilith's HP hits 0, the circle created at the start of the fight will disappear and 20 seconds later Echo of Lilith, Mother of Mankind will spawn in the center. Lilith opens up the fight with a semi-fixed sequence of attacks: After that she behaves similar to her first phase. She casts Blood Orb Creation whenever its 15s cooldown is ready and otherwise randomly chooses between Melee Combo, Flight (~20s cooldown), and Shadow Clone (~20s cooldown). During this part of the fight, the only threatening attack Lilith has is Shadow Clone, but with plenty of space to dodge it, you can always run in a big circle and be completely fine. Instead, you should focus at dealing damage and managing Blood Orbs. When the Blood Orb Creation is coming up, move next to (or even inside of) one of the existing Blood Orbs to make sure that their numbers don't increase. Staggering Lilith at this stage is also beneficial as it will destroy some of the Blood Orbs. Alternatively, you can just run to the top of the arena to spawn new Blood Orbs, as this section of the arena will soon be destroyed. This, however, makes the next phase transition very hard to survive, so only do this if you have an Invulnerability skill to help you. After Lilith's HP falls below 85% she will finish her current attack and use Flight (bottom to top). After that, she performs a special move (Lilith can't be Staggered during this time) where she uses her wings to destroy part of the arena. This section overlaps with the safe zone of previously used Flight and players standing on it take minor damage over time. 6 seconds later, the cut-off section crumbles down into the abyss, instantly killing all players standing on it. While the platform is crumbling and for 2 second after, Blood Orbs shoot Souls at the player. 2 Souls are created each second, regardless of the number of currently active Blood Orbs. Souls move at ~133% Movement Speed and home in on their target, but their turn speed is very low, making it possible to sidestep them. Souls deal heavy damage on contact. After the platform is broken, Lilith teleports to the center of arena and uses Ground Slam. Dodging all these attacks can be tricky but it becomes much easier if you can outrun the Souls. Then you just have to run in a large circle, timing it in such a way that you enter the crumbling platform right before the blood on the floor starts burning, and then leave it before it falls down, all without stopping. In this case, you only have to worry about the Souls coming straight at you and you Evade or simply take a step to the side to dodge them. Be aware that the pull from the Ground Slam attack will happen while there's still some Souls out, so you need to make sure that there are no Souls between you and arena's center when it happens (or simply use Unstoppable ability to prevent the pull). The second stage of the fight is no different from the first one, but now Lilith has one more ability to choose from: Ground Slam. The next stage begins when Lilith HP falls below 60% mark. Lilith will once again open up with Flight (bottom left to top right) and then will start breaking off the corner of the platform. Unlike the first time, the safe zone of Flight doesn't perfectly overlap with the crumbling platform and there's some burning blood in the left corner of it. There's nothing different in the way you dodge this attack but it's a bit more difficult because the safe zone and the arena itself is now smaller. After the platform is broken, Lilith will teleport to the center and use Ground Slam. During this stage of the fight, Lilith doesn't gain any new abilities but she gets some upgrades: When Lilith falls below 30% HP, she will break the last corner of the platform, starting with Flight (bottom right to top left), then platform break with all the bells whistles and Souls. As she destroys the last platform, she will cast Shadow Clone. After this, the fight continues but Lilith now has no cooldown on her Flight ability and will often use it twice in a row in opposite directions, forcing you to run from one end of the arena to the other and stand in a tiny safe zone while dodging all the Souls coming for you. On top of that, the arena itself is so small now that you barely have space to dodge her Ground Slam and Shadow Clone attacks. Needless to say, staying alive and dealing damage is extremely difficult so it's recommended to Stagger Lilith either right before or right after the last transition and then deal as much damage as possible to shorten this stage of the fight or even outright kill her. The above description of the fight tells you what happens if you slowly and steadily deal damage to Lilith and she has plenty of time to perform all her special attacks. Things can be very different if your damage is overwhelmingly high and certain parts of the fight can be outright skipped. For example, if you deal 60% of Lilith's HP in one hit at the beginning of the fight, she will go up and then come down to summon Oppressors, and you will never have to fight any Enforcers. Now, most builds can't do that kind of damage but that's where Stagger comes in. Staggering Lilith lets you deal damage to her for 5 seconds uninterrupted and many builds can deal serious damage during that timeframe. If you Stagger her before she gets below 70% HP and then kill her before Stagger ends, you skip the most difficult parts of the first phase. If you manage to build stagger fast enough to Stagger her during the opening sequence of attacks, then you can finish the fight without dodging once. Depending on your damage output you can aim to stagger her at different HP thresholds: To manipulate the moment when Stagger happens you need to adjust the amount of stagger damage your build deals. There's two ways to do that: If you lack the damage to skip parts of the fight within one stagger, you can swap your gear during the fight. For example, you can use to build up Stagger and then switch to offensive gloves and during the Stagger. Reviewed by"

This attack can be easily outranged or side-stepped, but its damage is so low that most builds can just facetank it and use it as an opportunity to deal damage. Lilith creates a series of parallel fissures on the ground which explode after a 1 second delay, dealing damage to players standing on top of them. This version is used when Lilith is above 70% HP. Don't stand in the fire if you want to avoid the damage, but, similar to Melee Combo, this ability's damage is low enough for most builds to simply ignore it. Lilith creates two series of parallel fissures on the ground in a criss-cross pattern. Fissures explode after a 1 second delay, dealing damage to players standing on top of them. Standing on the intersection of two fissures deals damage twice. This version is used when Lilith is below 70% HP. The damage this ability stays the same but double-hit can be dangerous to more squishy builds, so don't stand on the intersection of two lines. Lilith turns to face the player and then summons two shadow clones of herself. After a brief delay, Lilith and her clones jump backwards while launching forward a wide wave of demonic spikes that deals lethal damage on contact. The easiest way to dodge this attack is to simply move behind Lilith while she is preparing the wave. If Lilith's back is to the edge of the arena and you can't stand behind her, you need to run backwards and to the side to get out of the way. In some cases the wave can be aimed directly through the arena's center, making it impossible to dodge without leaving the circle. To prevent this from happening, never stand between Lilith and the center of the arena when you both are close to the edge. Lilith leaps upward, briefly leaving the arena. After a 1.2 second delay, 3 warning markers are created on the ground: one directly next to the player and two more to the sides and slightly back. One second later, Lilith's shadow clones come crashing down and launch 3 narrow waves of demonic spikes from the position of the markers. Finally, Lilith herself comes down, launching the 4th wave down the middle lane from further back. This version is available at all times. As soon as you see Lilith crouch before her jump, start moving to the edge of the arena. If you get there fast enough, all the launching spots of the waves will be inside the circle. Then all you have to do is run to the opposite side until you get behind the 4th warning marker. This way you are never in a path of any waves and you are also right next to the Lilith's landing spot, ready to deal damage. If you fail to get to the edge of the arena in time, the safe areas may land outside the circle. In that case you have to dodge the attack the hard way. Move to the side of the first marker to let the wave pass you by. As soon as it passes, immediately get behind it to avoid the incoming side wave. Again, as soon as side wave passes, go behind it again to avoid the final wave coming down the middle. Keep in mind that the hitbox of the waves is slightly in front of them (which is further exacerbated by your latency), meaning that you will get hit before the wave even touches you. On the bright side, that also means that back side of the wave is quite safe: if you approach a wave from behind you can literally stand on top of the spikes without taking damage. Lilith leaps upward, briefly leaving the arena. After a 1.2 second delay, 3 warning markers are created on the ground: one directly next to the player and two more to the sides and far behind. One second later, Lilith's shadow clones come crashing down and launch 3 narrow waves of demonic spikes from the position of the markers. Finally Lilith herself comes down, launching the 4th wave down the middle lane from further back. This version is available when Lilith is below 70% HP. The exact same strategy can be used for this version: run to the edge, wait for marker, run to to opposite side to get behind the 4th wave. Since you always stay in the middle lane you don't have to worry about side waves no matter what direction they go. If you fail to get to the edge of the arena in time, you need to dodge differently. Get behind the first marker and then run behind the wave as closely as you can. When the side waves pass by, get out of the middle to avoid the incoming last wave. If the first marker is at the edge of the circle and you can't get behind it, simply run backwards and to the side to get behind one of the side waves. In this version, there are 3 waves going along the sides of a triangle in clockwise direction. Lilith herself comes down in the center of the triangle, dealing lethal damage in large circular AoE. This version is available when Lilith is below 40% HP. The general method of dodging remains the same: you need to get to one side of the circle so that the attack is aimed off-center, and then quickly dash to the safe area on the opposite site. Keep in mind that that the waves continue traveling past the vertices of the triangle so the to be safe you need to be completely outside it. Unlike the previous two versions, this attack leaves you with less time to react since you need to get out of the central AoE quickly. If you fail to get to the edge of the arena in time, there might be no safe zones at all and then only Invulnerability can save you. This version also has only 3 first waves from the second version. Instead of launching 4th wave down the middle, Lilith comes down directly next to the player, dealing lethal damage in large circular AoE. This version is available when Lilith is below 40% HP. The general method of dodging remains the same: you need to get to one side of the circle so that the attack is aimed off-center, and then quickly dash to the safe area on the opposite site. If you stay in the middle lane while doing that, don't forget about incoming wave that will come a few seconds later. Move left or right when the side waves pass you. If you fail to get to the edge of the arena in time, there might be no safe zones at all and then only Invulnerability can save you. Lilith plunges her tail into the ground while siphoning blood out of the player at the same time, dealing unavoidable damage and creating 8 Dancing Blood Orbs going around the player in two concentric circles. After a brief delay an explosion of blood goes off next to the player dealing damage and creating a new Blood Orb in the center. All previously created Blood Orbs caught in the explosion are destroyed. Dancing Blood Orbs deal minor damage and make the player Vulnerable for 2.5 seconds upon impact. After orbiting the player's original position for 5 seconds, Dancing Blood Orbs swiftly fly out of the arena. In this phase, Blood Orbs are not enemies but obstacles on the map. Stepping into a Blood Orb deals low damage over time to the player and slows them. During certain attacks in this phase, Blood Orbs create deadly Red Souls that chase down the player. If Lilith is Staggered, all Blood Orbs except two (selected at random) are destroyed. This attack applies a stacking debuff to the player, which increases its damage by 2% per stack. The initial hit and the blood explosion apply 2 stacks and each Dancing Blood Orb applies 1 stack on hit. The initial hit is unavoidable. Its damage grows over time, so you need to have enough DPS to end the fight before you accumulate too many stacks of the debuff. The explosion deals high damage but it's easy to dodge with Evade if you remember it's coming. This version of the attack does the same initial damage and creates Dancing Blood Orbs, but instead of creating a single blood explosion next to the player 4 explosions happen in different corners of the arena and 4 Blood Orbs are created. This version is used at the beginning of the second phase when there are no active Blood Orbs on the arena. It can be skipped completely if you manage to take Lilith below 85% health before she spawns them, making this entire phase significantly easier. Lilith strikes the player 1-3 times with her tail. Similar to first phase, the damage of this attack is so low that most builds can just facetank it and use it as an opportunity to deal damage. Lilith flies up into the air and pulls all enemies towards herself while slowing them for 3 seconds. At the same time, she summons 4-6 (depending on her HP) Children of Lilith. After a 2 second delay, Lilith slams down onto the ground, dealing lethal damage in a large circle. Children of Lilith are a ghoul type enemies who pose no threat on their own but can become a source of Souls during certain attacks. If you get hit by the pull + slow you won't be able to get out of the AoE by just running. You need to use an ability to prevent the pull or to remove the slow. Alternatively, you can use a mobility skill or 2-3 Evade charges to get out even while slowed. After dodging, kill the Children before continuing to fight Lilith. Lilith lets out a scream, knocking the player back. After that, Lilith dashes towards the player and shoots a three-pronged fork of shadows at the player, which deals heavy damage. Then she does this dash + fork combo a second time. At the same time, a shadow clone of Lilith is created nearby, which mimics her initial scream and two fork attacks with a 1 second delay. After all 4 forks are shot, Lilith slams the ground near player's position, releasing a massive shadow explosion that deals lethal damage. If Lilith is killed or Staggered during this attack, the shadow clone will continue acting on its own. Since Lilith's death animation is very long, you will receive no rewards for double KO. Very tanky builds can survive a single hit by a fork, but most have to dodge this attack entirely. To do that, move away from Lilith and run in a large circle. Each fork's middle prong is always aimed directly at you, so you will always dodge it as long as you move laterally. In doing so, you risk running into one of the side prongs, so you need to either be far enough away from Lilith or slow down a bit after you dodge the middle one. When Lilith raises her wings before the final part of the attack, move quickly to the opposite side of the arena to avoid the explosion. Lilith flies up and leaves the arena. After a brief delay, she comes back flying across the entire battlefield, covering the ground behind her in a thick layer of cursed blood. After a 3 second delay, the blood ignites, dealing lethal damage to all enemies caught in it for the next 2 seconds. There's always a safe zone at the side of the arena where Lilith finishes her flight. This attack is trivial to dodge on it's own and only becomes dangerous when combined with Souls chasing down the player. Remember that no damage is done until the blood catches fire, so you don't need to rush into the safe zone immediately.

Stepping outside of the circle will deal extremely high damage over time to the player.

She will never do Melee Combo more than twice in a row. Otherwise the attacks are selected at random. During this stage of the fight, Lilith has long cooldowns on her high-damage attacks, giving you plenty of time to damage her and/or apply Stagger. Be ready to dodge Wave of Spikes or Death From Above when they come and you should be able to get through this stage without much trouble. When Lilith's health goes below 70%, she will finish her attack and summon 2 Enforcers. After that, she will continuously use Death From Above as long as at least one of the Enforcers is alive (but no less than 2 times). Each Enforcer will leave behind 2 Volatile Bloods and  6 Health Potion charges upon death. Enforcers themselves deal almost no damage. Your primary focus should be on dodging the Death From Above spam while killing them. Stay at the edge of the arena and let the Enforcers come to you. Be mindful of their pull attack as it can move you into the one-shot attacks from Lilith. If your build is not great at cleaning up Volatile Blood, try to kill the minions one-by-one and kill the Blood in-between. After you kill both minions, the camera returns to the normal zoom level and the second stage of the fight begins. Lilith's abilities are upgraded: Her attacks, in general, will follow this pattern: Your best strategy is to focus on dodging during steps 1-3 and doing damage during step 4. Since her Blood Orb Creation now has reduced cooldown and still has highest priority, the attack in step 2 will often be Blood Orb Creation. It's recommended to focus on dodging the incoming Death From Above first and killing Volatile Bloods second. Since Volatile Bloods take 12 seconds to detonate, you have plenty of time to kill it without the threat of a one-shot hanging over you. When Lilith's health goes below 40%, she will finish her attack and summon 3 Oppressors. Same as the first minion phase, she will spam use Death From Above as long as her minions live.

Stay at the edge of the arena at all times to make dodging easier and slowly work through her HP bar. When Lilith's HP hits 0, the circle created at the start of the fight will disappear and 20 seconds later Echo of Lilith, Mother of Mankind will spawn in the center. Lilith opens up the fight with a semi-fixed sequence of attacks: After that she behaves similar to her first phase. She casts Blood Orb Creation whenever its 15s cooldown is ready and otherwise randomly chooses between Melee Combo, Flight (~20s cooldown), and Shadow Clone (~20s cooldown). During this part of the fight, the only threatening attack Lilith has is Shadow Clone, but with plenty of space to dodge it, you can always run in a big circle and be completely fine. Instead, you should focus at dealing damage and managing Blood Orbs. When the Blood Orb Creation is coming up, move next to (or even inside of) one of the existing Blood Orbs to make sure that their numbers don't increase. Staggering Lilith at this stage is also beneficial as it will destroy some of the Blood Orbs. Alternatively, you can just run to the top of the arena to spawn new Blood Orbs, as this section of the arena will soon be destroyed. This, however, makes the next phase transition very hard to survive, so only do this if you have an Invulnerability skill to help you. After Lilith's HP falls below 85% she will finish her current attack and use Flight (bottom to top). After that, she performs a special move (Lilith can't be Staggered during this time) where she uses her wings to destroy part of the arena. This section overlaps with the safe zone of previously used Flight and players standing on it take minor damage over time. 6 seconds later, the cut-off section crumbles down into the abyss, instantly killing all players standing on it. While the platform is crumbling and for 2 second after, Blood Orbs shoot Souls at the player. 2 Souls are created each second, regardless of the number of currently active Blood Orbs. Souls move at ~133% Movement Speed and home in on their target, but their turn speed is very low, making it possible to sidestep them. Souls deal heavy damage on contact."

Lilith plunges her tail into the ground while siphoning blood out of the player at the same time, dealing unavoidable damage and creating 8 Dancing Blood Orbs going around the player in two concentric circles. After a brief delay an explosion of blood goes off next to the player dealing damage and creating a new Blood Orb in the center. All previously created Blood Orbs caught in the explosion are destroyed. Dancing Blood Orbs deal minor damage and make the player Vulnerable for 2.5 seconds upon impact. After orbiting the player's original position for 5 seconds, Dancing Blood Orbs swiftly fly out of the arena. In this phase, Blood Orbs are not enemies but obstacles on the map. Stepping into a Blood Orb deals low damage over time to the player and slows them. During certain attacks in this phase, Blood Orbs create deadly Red Souls that chase down the player. If Lilith is Staggered, all Blood Orbs except two (selected at random) are destroyed. This attack applies a stacking debuff to the player, which increases its damage by 2% per stack. The initial hit and the blood explosion apply 2 stacks and each Dancing Blood Orb applies 1 stack on hit. The initial hit is unavoidable. Its damage grows over time, so you need to have enough DPS to end the fight before you accumulate too many stacks of the debuff. The explosion deals high damage but it's easy to dodge with Evade if you remember it's coming. This version of the attack does the same initial damage and creates Dancing Blood Orbs, but instead of creating a single blood explosion next to the player 4 explosions happen in different corners of the arena and 4 Blood Orbs are created. This version is used at the beginning of the second phase when there are no active Blood Orbs on the arena. It can be skipped completely if you manage to take Lilith below 85% health before she spawns them, making this entire phase significantly easier. Lilith strikes the player 1-3 times with her tail. Similar to first phase, the damage of this attack is so low that most builds can just facetank it and use it as an opportunity to deal damage. Lilith flies up into the air and pulls all enemies towards herself while slowing them for 3 seconds. At the same time, she summons 4-6 (depending on her HP) Children of Lilith. After a 2 second delay, Lilith slams down onto the ground, dealing lethal damage in a large circle. Children of Lilith are a ghoul type enemies who pose no threat on their own but can become a source of Souls during certain attacks. If you get hit by the pull + slow you won't be able to get out of the AoE by just running. You need to use an ability to prevent the pull or to remove the slow. Alternatively, you can use a mobility skill or 2-3 Evade charges to get out even while slowed. After dodging, kill the Children before continuing to fight Lilith. Lilith lets out a scream, knocking the player back. After that, Lilith dashes towards the player and shoots a three-pronged fork of shadows at the player, which deals heavy damage. Then she does this dash + fork combo a second time. At the same time, a shadow clone of Lilith is created nearby, which mimics her initial scream and two fork attacks with a 1 second delay. After all 4 forks are shot, Lilith slams the ground near player's position, releasing a massive shadow explosion that deals lethal damage. If Lilith is killed or Staggered during this attack, the shadow clone will continue acting on its own. Since Lilith's death animation is very long, you will receive no rewards for double KO. Very tanky builds can survive a single hit by a fork, but most have to dodge this attack entirely. To do that, move away from Lilith and run in a large circle. Each fork's middle prong is always aimed directly at you, so you will always dodge it as long as you move laterally. In doing so, you risk running into one of the side prongs, so you need to either be far enough away from Lilith or slow down a bit after you dodge the middle one. When Lilith raises her wings before the final part of the attack, move quickly to the opposite side of the arena to avoid the explosion. Lilith flies up and leaves the arena. After a brief delay, she comes back flying across the entire battlefield, covering the ground behind her in a thick layer of cursed blood. After a 3 second delay, the blood ignites, dealing lethal damage to all enemies caught in it for the next 2 seconds. There's always a safe zone at the side of the arena where Lilith finishes her flight. This attack is trivial to dodge on it's own and only becomes dangerous when combined with Souls chasing down the player. Remember that no damage is done until the blood catches fire, so you don't need to rush into the safe zone immediately. After player enters the arena, Lilith will drop down in the center, knocking the player back and creating a Circle of Doom that limits the size of the playable area. Stepping outside of the circle will deal extremely high damage over time to the player. The fight always starts with the fixed sequence of attacks: After that she will select one of 5 attacks available to her: Lilith will always prioritize Blood Orb Creation if it's not on cooldown. She will never do Melee Combo more than twice in a row. Otherwise the attacks are selected at random. During this stage of the fight, Lilith has long cooldowns on her high-damage attacks, giving you plenty of time to damage her and/or apply Stagger. Be ready to dodge Wave of Spikes or Death From Above when they come and you should be able to get through this stage without much trouble. When Lilith's health goes below 70%, she will finish her attack and summon 2 Enforcers. After that, she will continuously use Death From Above as long as at least one of the Enforcers is alive (but no less than 2 times). Each Enforcer will leave behind 2 Volatile Bloods and  6 Health Potion charges upon death. Enforcers themselves deal almost no damage. Your primary focus should be on dodging the Death From Above spam while killing them. Stay at the edge of the arena and let the Enforcers come to you. Be mindful of their pull attack as it can move you into the one-shot attacks from Lilith. If your build is not great at cleaning up Volatile Blood, try to kill the minions one-by-one and kill the Blood in-between. After you kill both minions, the camera returns to the normal zoom level and the second stage of the fight begins. Lilith's abilities are upgraded: Her attacks, in general, will follow this pattern: Your best strategy is to focus on dodging during steps 1-3 and doing damage during step 4. Since her Blood Orb Creation now has reduced cooldown and still has highest priority, the attack in step 2 will often be Blood Orb Creation. It's recommended to focus on dodging the incoming Death From Above first and killing Volatile Bloods second. Since Volatile Bloods take 12 seconds to detonate, you have plenty of time to kill it without the threat of a one-shot hanging over you. When Lilith's health goes below 40%, she will finish her attack and summon 3 Oppressors. Same as the first minion phase, she will spam use Death From Above as long as her minions live. This phase is not very different from the first one. Now there are 3 minions instead of 2 but they pose little threat and all the danger is coming from now further upgraded Death From Above. Our strategy stays the same: focus on dodging first and killing second. After the minions die, the fight continues with more improvements to Lilith's attacks: During this stage Lilith will simply use Death From Above after every 2-3 attacks giving you little time to deal damage. Stay at the edge of the arena at all times to make dodging easier and slowly work through her HP bar. When Lilith's HP hits 0, the circle created at the start of the fight will disappear and 20 seconds later Echo of Lilith, Mother of Mankind will spawn in the center. Lilith opens up the fight with a semi-fixed sequence of attacks:"

    "heading": "Shadow Clone",
    "content": "Lilith creates a series of parallel fissures on the ground which explode after a 1 second delay, dealing damage to players standing on top of them. This version is used when Lilith is above 70% HP. Don't stand in the fire if you want to avoid the damage, but, similar to Melee Combo, this ability's damage is low enough for most builds to simply ignore it. Lilith creates two series of parallel fissures on the ground in a criss-cross pattern. Fissures explode after a 1 second delay, dealing damage to players standing on top of them. Standing on the intersection of two fissures deals damage twice. This version is used when Lilith is below 70% HP. The damage this ability stays the same but double-hit can be dangerous to more squishy builds, so don't stand on the intersection of two lines. Lilith turns to face the player and then summons two shadow clones of herself. After a brief delay, Lilith and her clones jump backwards while launching forward a wide wave of demonic spikes that deals lethal damage on contact. The easiest way to dodge this attack is to simply move behind Lilith while she is preparing the wave. If Lilith's back is to the edge of the arena and you can't stand behind her, you need to run backwards and to the side to get out of the way. In some cases the wave can be aimed directly through the arena's center, making it impossible to dodge without leaving the circle. To prevent this from happening, never stand between Lilith and the center of the arena when you both are close to the edge. Lilith leaps upward, briefly leaving the arena. After a 1.2 second delay, 3 warning markers are created on the ground: one directly next to the player and two more to the sides and slightly back. One second later, Lilith's shadow clones come crashing down and launch 3 narrow waves of demonic spikes from the position of the markers. Finally, Lilith herself comes down, launching the 4th wave down the middle lane from further back. This version is available at all times. As soon as you see Lilith crouch before her jump, start moving to the edge of the arena. If you get there fast enough, all the launching spots of the waves will be inside the circle. Then all you have to do is run to the opposite side until you get behind the 4th warning marker. This way you are never in a path of any waves and you are also right next to the Lilith's landing spot, ready to deal damage. If you fail to get to the edge of the arena in time, the safe areas may land outside the circle. In that case you have to dodge the attack the hard way. Move to the side of the first marker to let the wave pass you by. As soon as it passes, immediately get behind it to avoid the incoming side wave. Again, as soon as side wave passes, go behind it again to avoid the final wave coming down the middle. Keep in mind that the hitbox of the waves is slightly in front of them (which is further exacerbated by your latency), meaning that you will get hit before the wave even touches you. On the bright side, that also means that back side of the wave is quite safe: if you approach a wave from behind you can literally stand on top of the spikes without taking damage. Lilith leaps upward, briefly leaving the arena. After a 1.2 second delay, 3 warning markers are created on the ground: one directly next to the player and two more to the sides and far behind. One second later, Lilith's shadow clones come crashing down and launch 3 narrow waves of demonic spikes from the position of the markers. Finally Lilith herself comes down, launching the 4th wave down the middle lane from further back. This version is available when Lilith is below 70% HP. The exact same strategy can be used for this version: run to the edge, wait for marker, run to to opposite side to get behind the 4th wave. Since you always stay in the middle lane you don't have to worry about side waves no matter what direction they go. If you fail to get to the edge of the arena in time, you need to dodge differently. Get behind the first marker and then run behind the wave as closely as you can. When the side waves pass by, get out of the middle to avoid the incoming last wave. If the first marker is at the edge of the circle and you can't get behind it, simply run backwards and to the side to get behind one of the side waves. In this version, there are 3 waves going along the sides of a triangle in clockwise direction. Lilith herself comes down in the center of the triangle, dealing lethal damage in large circular AoE. This version is available when Lilith is below 40% HP. The general method of dodging remains the same: you need to get to one side of the circle so that the attack is aimed off-center, and then quickly dash to the safe area on the opposite site. Keep in mind that that the waves continue traveling past the vertices of the triangle so the to be safe you need to be completely outside it. Unlike the previous two versions, this attack leaves you with less time to react since you need to get out of the central AoE quickly. If you fail to get to the edge of the arena in time, there might be no safe zones at all and then only Invulnerability can save you. This version also has only 3 first waves from the second version. Instead of launching 4th wave down the middle, Lilith comes down directly next to the player, dealing lethal damage in large circular AoE. This version is available when Lilith is below 40% HP. The general method of dodging remains the same: you need to get to one side of the circle so that the attack is aimed off-center, and then quickly dash to the safe area on the opposite site. If you stay in the middle lane while doing that, don't forget about incoming wave that will come a few seconds later. Move left or right when the side waves pass you.

The explosion deals high damage but it's easy to dodge with Evade if you remember it's coming.

After all 4 forks are shot, Lilith slams the ground near player's position, releasing a massive shadow explosion that deals lethal damage.

This phase is not very different from the first one. Now there are 3 minions instead of 2 but they pose little threat and all the danger is coming from now further upgraded Death From Above. Our strategy stays the same: focus on dodging first and killing second. After the minions die, the fight continues with more improvements to Lilith's attacks: During this stage Lilith will simply use Death From Above after every 2-3 attacks giving you little time to deal damage. Stay at the edge of the arena at all times to make dodging easier and slowly work through her HP bar. When Lilith's HP hits 0, the circle created at the start of the fight will disappear and 20 seconds later Echo of Lilith, Mother of Mankind will spawn in the center. Lilith opens up the fight with a semi-fixed sequence of attacks: After that she behaves similar to her first phase. She casts Blood Orb Creation whenever its 15s cooldown is ready and otherwise randomly chooses between Melee Combo, Flight (~20s cooldown), and Shadow Clone (~20s cooldown). During this part of the fight, the only threatening attack Lilith has is Shadow Clone, but with plenty of space to dodge it, you can always run in a big circle and be completely fine. Instead, you should focus at dealing damage and managing Blood Orbs. When the Blood Orb Creation is coming up, move next to (or even inside of) one of the existing Blood Orbs to make sure that their numbers don't increase. Staggering Lilith at this stage is also beneficial as it will destroy some of the Blood Orbs. Alternatively, you can just run to the top of the arena to spawn new Blood Orbs, as this section of the arena will soon be destroyed. This, however, makes the next phase transition very hard to survive, so only do this if you have an Invulnerability skill to help you. After Lilith's HP falls below 85% she will finish her current attack and use Flight (bottom to top). After that, she performs a special move (Lilith can't be Staggered during this time) where she uses her wings to destroy part of the arena. This section overlaps with the safe zone of previously used Flight and players standing on it take minor damage over time. 6 seconds later, the cut-off section crumbles down into the abyss, instantly killing all players standing on it. While the platform is crumbling and for 2 second after, Blood Orbs shoot Souls at the player. 2 Souls are created each second, regardless of the number of currently active Blood Orbs. Souls move at ~133% Movement Speed and home in on their target, but their turn speed is very low, making it possible to sidestep them. Souls deal heavy damage on contact. After the platform is broken, Lilith teleports to the center of arena and uses Ground Slam. Dodging all these attacks can be tricky but it becomes much easier if you can outrun the Souls. Then you just have to run in a large circle, timing it in such a way that you enter the crumbling platform right before the blood on the floor starts burning, and then leave it before it falls down, all without stopping. In this case, you only have to worry about the Souls coming straight at you and you Evade or simply take a step to the side to dodge them. Be aware that the pull from the Ground Slam attack will happen while there's still some Souls out, so you need to make sure that there are no Souls between you and arena's center when it happens (or simply use Unstoppable ability to prevent the pull). The second stage of the fight is no different from the first one, but now Lilith has one more ability to choose from: Ground Slam. The next stage begins when Lilith HP falls below 60% mark. Lilith will once again open up with Flight (bottom left to top right) and then will start breaking off the corner of the platform. Unlike the first time, the safe zone of Flight doesn't perfectly overlap with the crumbling platform and there's some burning blood in the left corner of it. There's nothing different in the way you dodge this attack but it's a bit more difficult because the safe zone and the arena itself is now smaller. After the platform is broken, Lilith will teleport to the center and use Ground Slam. During this stage of the fight, Lilith doesn't gain any new abilities but she gets some upgrades: When Lilith falls below 30% HP, she will break the last corner of the platform, starting with Flight (bottom right to top left), then platform break with all the bells whistles and Souls. As she destroys the last platform, she will cast Shadow Clone. After this, the fight continues but Lilith now has no cooldown on her Flight ability and will often use it twice in a row in opposite directions, forcing you to run from one end of the arena to the other and stand in a tiny safe zone while dodging all the Souls coming for you. On top of that, the arena itself is so small now that you barely have space to dodge her Ground Slam and Shadow Clone attacks. Needless to say, staying alive and dealing damage is extremely difficult so it's recommended to Stagger Lilith either right before or right after the last transition and then deal as much damage as possible to shorten this stage of the fight or even outright kill her. The above description of the fight tells you what happens if you slowly and steadily deal damage to Lilith and she has plenty of time to perform all her special attacks. Things can be very different if your damage is overwhelmingly high and certain parts of the fight can be outright skipped. For example, if you deal 60% of Lilith's HP in one hit at the beginning of the fight, she will go up and then come down to summon Oppressors, and you will never have to fight any Enforcers. Now, most builds can't do that kind of damage but that's where Stagger comes in. Staggering Lilith lets you deal damage to her for 5 seconds uninterrupted and many builds can deal serious damage during that timeframe. If you Stagger her before she gets below 70% HP and then kill her before Stagger ends, you skip the most difficult parts of the first phase. If you manage to build stagger fast enough to Stagger her during the opening sequence of attacks, then you can finish the fight without dodging once. Depending on your damage output you can aim to stagger her at different HP thresholds: To manipulate the moment when Stagger happens you need to adjust the amount of stagger damage your build deals. There's two ways to do that: If you lack the damage to skip parts of the fight within one stagger, you can swap your gear during the fight. For example, you can use to build up Stagger and then switch to offensive gloves and during the Stagger. Reviewed by"

    "heading": "First Minion Phase",
    "content": "Don't stand in the fire if you want to avoid the damage, but, similar to Melee Combo, this ability's damage is low enough for most builds to simply ignore it. Lilith creates two series of parallel fissures on the ground in a criss-cross pattern. Fissures explode after a 1 second delay, dealing damage to players standing on top of them. Standing on the intersection of two fissures deals damage twice. This version is used when Lilith is below 70% HP. The damage this ability stays the same but double-hit can be dangerous to more squishy builds, so don't stand on the intersection of two lines. Lilith turns to face the player and then summons two shadow clones of herself. After a brief delay, Lilith and her clones jump backwards while launching forward a wide wave of demonic spikes that deals lethal damage on contact. The easiest way to dodge this attack is to simply move behind Lilith while she is preparing the wave. If Lilith's back is to the edge of the arena and you can't stand behind her, you need to run backwards and to the side to get out of the way. In some cases the wave can be aimed directly through the arena's center, making it impossible to dodge without leaving the circle. To prevent this from happening, never stand between Lilith and the center of the arena when you both are close to the edge. Lilith leaps upward, briefly leaving the arena. After a 1.2 second delay, 3 warning markers are created on the ground: one directly next to the player and two more to the sides and slightly back. One second later, Lilith's shadow clones come crashing down and launch 3 narrow waves of demonic spikes from the position of the markers. Finally, Lilith herself comes down, launching the 4th wave down the middle lane from further back. This version is available at all times. As soon as you see Lilith crouch before her jump, start moving to the edge of the arena. If you get there fast enough, all the launching spots of the waves will be inside the circle. Then all you have to do is run to the opposite side until you get behind the 4th warning marker. This way you are never in a path of any waves and you are also right next to the Lilith's landing spot, ready to deal damage. If you fail to get to the edge of the arena in time, the safe areas may land outside the circle. In that case you have to dodge the attack the hard way. Move to the side of the first marker to let the wave pass you by. As soon as it passes, immediately get behind it to avoid the incoming side wave. Again, as soon as side wave passes, go behind it again to avoid the final wave coming down the middle. Keep in mind that the hitbox of the waves is slightly in front of them (which is further exacerbated by your latency), meaning that you will get hit before the wave even touches you. On the bright side, that also means that back side of the wave is quite safe: if you approach a wave from behind you can literally stand on top of the spikes without taking damage. Lilith leaps upward, briefly leaving the arena. After a 1.2 second delay, 3 warning markers are created on the ground: one directly next to the player and two more to the sides and far behind. One second later, Lilith's shadow clones come crashing down and launch 3 narrow waves of demonic spikes from the position of the markers. Finally Lilith herself comes down, launching the 4th wave down the middle lane from further back. This version is available when Lilith is below 70% HP. The exact same strategy can be used for this version: run to the edge, wait for marker, run to to opposite side to get behind the 4th wave. Since you always stay in the middle lane you don't have to worry about side waves no matter what direction they go. If you fail to get to the edge of the arena in time, you need to dodge differently. Get behind the first marker and then run behind the wave as closely as you can. When the side waves pass by, get out of the middle to avoid the incoming last wave. If the first marker is at the edge of the circle and you can't get behind it, simply run backwards and to the side to get behind one of the side waves. In this version, there are 3 waves going along the sides of a triangle in clockwise direction. Lilith herself comes down in the center of the triangle, dealing lethal damage in large circular AoE. This version is available when Lilith is below 40% HP. The general method of dodging remains the same: you need to get to one side of the circle so that the attack is aimed off-center, and then quickly dash to the safe area on the opposite site. Keep in mind that that the waves continue traveling past the vertices of the triangle so the to be safe you need to be completely outside it. Unlike the previous two versions, this attack leaves you with less time to react since you need to get out of the central AoE quickly. If you fail to get to the edge of the arena in time, there might be no safe zones at all and then only Invulnerability can save you. This version also has only 3 first waves from the second version. Instead of launching 4th wave down the middle, Lilith comes down directly next to the player, dealing lethal damage in large circular AoE. This version is available when Lilith is below 40% HP. The general method of dodging remains the same: you need to get to one side of the circle so that the attack is aimed off-center, and then quickly dash to the safe area on the opposite site. If you stay in the middle lane while doing that, don't forget about incoming wave that will come a few seconds later. Move left or right when the side waves pass you. If you fail to get to the edge of the arena in time, there might be no safe zones at all and then only Invulnerability can save you. Lilith plunges her tail into the ground while siphoning blood out of the player at the same time, dealing unavoidable damage and creating 8 Dancing Blood Orbs going around the player in two concentric circles. After a brief delay an explosion of blood goes off next to the player dealing damage and creating a new Blood Orb in the center. All previously created Blood Orbs caught in the explosion are destroyed. Dancing Blood Orbs deal minor damage and make the player Vulnerable for 2.5 seconds upon impact. After orbiting the player's original position for 5 seconds, Dancing Blood Orbs swiftly fly out of the arena. In this phase, Blood Orbs are not enemies but obstacles on the map. Stepping into a Blood Orb deals low damage over time to the player and slows them. During certain attacks in this phase, Blood Orbs create deadly Red Souls that chase down the player. If Lilith is Staggered, all Blood Orbs except two (selected at random) are destroyed. This attack applies a stacking debuff to the player, which increases its damage by 2% per stack. The initial hit and the blood explosion apply 2 stacks and each Dancing Blood Orb applies 1 stack on hit. The initial hit is unavoidable. Its damage grows over time, so you need to have enough DPS to end the fight before you accumulate too many stacks of the debuff. The explosion deals high damage but it's easy to dodge with Evade if you remember it's coming. This version of the attack does the same initial damage and creates Dancing Blood Orbs, but instead of creating a single blood explosion next to the player 4 explosions happen in different corners of the arena and 4 Blood Orbs are created. This version is used at the beginning of the second phase when there are no active Blood Orbs on the arena. It can be skipped completely if you manage to take Lilith below 85% health before she spawns them, making this entire phase significantly easier. Lilith strikes the player 1-3 times with her tail. Similar to first phase, the damage of this attack is so low that most builds can just facetank it and use it as an opportunity to deal damage. Lilith flies up into the air and pulls all enemies towards herself while slowing them for 3 seconds. At the same time, she summons 4-6 (depending on her HP) Children of Lilith. After a 2 second delay, Lilith slams down onto the ground, dealing lethal damage in a large circle. Children of Lilith are a ghoul type enemies who pose no threat on their own but can become a source of Souls during certain attacks. If you get hit by the pull + slow you won't be able to get out of the AoE by just running. You need to use an ability to prevent the pull or to remove the slow. Alternatively, you can use a mobility skill or 2-3 Evade charges to get out even while slowed. After dodging, kill the Children before continuing to fight Lilith. Lilith lets out a scream, knocking the player back. After that, Lilith dashes towards the player and shoots a three-pronged fork of shadows at the player, which deals heavy damage. Then she does this dash + fork combo a second time. At the same time, a shadow clone of Lilith is created nearby, which mimics her initial scream and two fork attacks with a 1 second delay. After all 4 forks are shot, Lilith slams the ground near player's position, releasing a massive shadow explosion that deals lethal damage. If Lilith is killed or Staggered during this attack, the shadow clone will continue acting on its own. Since Lilith's death animation is very long, you will receive no rewards for double KO. Very tanky builds can survive a single hit by a fork, but most have to dodge this attack entirely. To do that, move away from Lilith and run in a large circle. Each fork's middle prong is always aimed directly at you, so you will always dodge it as long as you move laterally. In doing so, you risk running into one of the side prongs, so you need to either be far enough away from Lilith or slow down a bit after you dodge the middle one. When Lilith raises her wings before the final part of the attack, move quickly to the opposite side of the arena to avoid the explosion. Lilith flies up and leaves the arena. After a brief delay, she comes back flying across the entire battlefield, covering the ground behind her in a thick layer of cursed blood. After a 3 second delay, the blood ignites, dealing lethal damage to all enemies caught in it for the next 2 seconds. There's always a safe zone at the side of the arena where Lilith finishes her flight. This attack is trivial to dodge on it's own and only becomes dangerous when combined with Souls chasing down the player. Remember that no damage is done until the blood catches fire, so you don't need to rush into the safe zone immediately. After player enters the arena, Lilith will drop down in the center, knocking the player back and creating a Circle of Doom that limits the size of the playable area. Stepping outside of the circle will deal extremely high damage over time to the player. The fight always starts with the fixed sequence of attacks: After that she will select one of 5 attacks available to her: Lilith will always prioritize Blood Orb Creation if it's not on cooldown. She will never do Melee Combo more than twice in a row. Otherwise the attacks are selected at random. During this stage of the fight, Lilith has long cooldowns on her high-damage attacks, giving you plenty of time to damage her and/or apply Stagger. Be ready to dodge Wave of Spikes or Death From Above when they come and you should be able to get through this stage without much trouble. When Lilith's health goes below 70%, she will finish her attack and summon 2 Enforcers. After that, she will continuously use Death From Above as long as at least one of the Enforcers is alive (but no less than 2 times). Each Enforcer will leave behind 2 Volatile Bloods and  6 Health Potion charges upon death. Enforcers themselves deal almost no damage. Your primary focus should be on dodging the Death From Above spam while killing them. Stay at the edge of the arena and let the Enforcers come to you. Be mindful of their pull attack as it can move you into the one-shot attacks from Lilith. If your build is not great at cleaning up Volatile Blood, try to kill the minions one-by-one and kill the Blood in-between. After you kill both minions, the camera returns to the normal zoom level and the second stage of the fight begins. Lilith's abilities are upgraded: Her attacks, in general, will follow this pattern: Your best strategy is to focus on dodging during steps 1-3 and doing damage during step 4. Since her Blood Orb Creation now has reduced cooldown and still has highest priority, the attack in step 2 will often be Blood Orb Creation. It's recommended to focus on dodging the incoming Death From Above first and killing Volatile Bloods second. Since Volatile Bloods take 12 seconds to detonate, you have plenty of time to kill it without the threat of a one-shot hanging over you. When Lilith's health goes below 40%, she will finish her attack and summon 3 Oppressors. Same as the first minion phase, she will spam use Death From Above as long as her minions live. This phase is not very different from the first one. Now there are 3 minions instead of 2 but they pose little threat and all the danger is coming from now further upgraded Death From Above. Our strategy stays the same: focus on dodging first and killing second. After the minions die, the fight continues with more improvements to Lilith's attacks: During this stage Lilith will simply use Death From Above after every 2-3 attacks giving you little time to deal damage. Stay at the edge of the arena at all times to make dodging easier and slowly work through her HP bar. When Lilith's HP hits 0, the circle created at the start of the fight will disappear and 20 seconds later Echo of Lilith, Mother of Mankind will spawn in the center. Lilith opens up the fight with a semi-fixed sequence of attacks: After that she behaves similar to her first phase. She casts Blood Orb Creation whenever its 15s cooldown is ready and otherwise randomly chooses between Melee Combo, Flight (~20s cooldown), and Shadow Clone (~20s cooldown). During this part of the fight, the only threatening attack Lilith has is Shadow Clone, but with plenty of space to dodge it, you can always run in a big circle and be completely fine. Instead, you should focus at dealing damage and managing Blood Orbs. When the Blood Orb Creation is coming up, move next to (or even inside of) one of the existing Blood Orbs to make sure that their numbers don't increase. Staggering Lilith at this stage is also beneficial as it will destroy some of the Blood Orbs. Alternatively, you can just run to the top of the arena to spawn new Blood Orbs, as this section of the arena will soon be destroyed. This, however, makes the next phase transition very hard to survive, so only do this if you have an Invulnerability skill to help you. After Lilith's HP falls below 85% she will finish her current attack and use Flight (bottom to top). After that, she performs a special move (Lilith can't be Staggered during this time) where she uses her wings to destroy part of the arena. This section overlaps with the safe zone of previously used Flight and players standing on it take minor damage over time. 6 seconds later, the cut-off section crumbles down into the abyss, instantly killing all players standing on it. While the platform is crumbling and for 2 second after, Blood Orbs shoot Souls at the player. 2 Souls are created each second, regardless of the number of currently active Blood Orbs. Souls move at ~133% Movement Speed and home in on their target, but their turn speed is very low, making it possible to sidestep them. Souls deal heavy damage on contact.

If Lilith is killed or Staggered during this attack, the shadow clone will continue acting on its own. Since Lilith's death animation is very long, you will receive no rewards for double KO. Very tanky builds can survive a single hit by a fork, but most have to dodge this attack entirely. To do that, move away from Lilith and run in a large circle. Each fork's middle prong is always aimed directly at you, so you will always dodge it as long as you move laterally. In doing so, you risk running into one of the side prongs, so you need to either be far enough away from Lilith or slow down a bit after you dodge the middle one. When Lilith raises her wings before the final part of the attack, move quickly to the opposite side of the arena to avoid the explosion. Lilith flies up and leaves the arena. After a brief delay, she comes back flying across the entire battlefield, covering the ground behind her in a thick layer of cursed blood. After a 3 second delay, the blood ignites, dealing lethal damage to all enemies caught in it for the next 2 seconds. There's always a safe zone at the side of the arena where Lilith finishes her flight. This attack is trivial to dodge on it's own and only becomes dangerous when combined with Souls chasing down the player. Remember that no damage is done until the blood catches fire, so you don't need to rush into the safe zone immediately. After player enters the arena, Lilith will drop down in the center, knocking the player back and creating a Circle of Doom that limits the size of the playable area. Stepping outside of the circle will deal extremely high damage over time to the player. The fight always starts with the fixed sequence of attacks: After that she will select one of 5 attacks available to her: Lilith will always prioritize Blood Orb Creation if it's not on cooldown. She will never do Melee Combo more than twice in a row. Otherwise the attacks are selected at random. During this stage of the fight, Lilith has long cooldowns on her high-damage attacks, giving you plenty of time to damage her and/or apply Stagger. Be ready to dodge Wave of Spikes or Death From Above when they come and you should be able to get through this stage without much trouble. When Lilith's health goes below 70%, she will finish her attack and summon 2 Enforcers. After that, she will continuously use Death From Above as long as at least one of the Enforcers is alive (but no less than 2 times). Each Enforcer will leave behind 2 Volatile Bloods and  6 Health Potion charges upon death. Enforcers themselves deal almost no damage. Your primary focus should be on dodging the Death From Above spam while killing them. Stay at the edge of the arena and let the Enforcers come to you. Be mindful of their pull attack as it can move you into the one-shot attacks from Lilith. If your build is not great at cleaning up Volatile Blood, try to kill the minions one-by-one and kill the Blood in-between. After you kill both minions, the camera returns to the normal zoom level and the second stage of the fight begins. Lilith's abilities are upgraded: Her attacks, in general, will follow this pattern: Your best strategy is to focus on dodging during steps 1-3 and doing damage during step 4. Since her Blood Orb Creation now has reduced cooldown and still has highest priority, the attack in step 2 will often be Blood Orb Creation. It's recommended to focus on dodging the incoming Death From Above first and killing Volatile Bloods second. Since Volatile Bloods take 12 seconds to detonate, you have plenty of time to kill it without the threat of a one-shot hanging over you. When Lilith's health goes below 40%, she will finish her attack and summon 3 Oppressors. Same as the first minion phase, she will spam use Death From Above as long as her minions live. This phase is not very different from the first one. Now there are 3 minions instead of 2 but they pose little threat and all the danger is coming from now further upgraded Death From Above. Our strategy stays the same: focus on dodging first and killing second. After the minions die, the fight continues with more improvements to Lilith's attacks: During this stage Lilith will simply use Death From Above after every 2-3 attacks giving you little time to deal damage. Stay at the edge of the arena at all times to make dodging easier and slowly work through her HP bar."

    "heading": "Lilith, Mother of Mankind",
    "content": "This version is used when Lilith is below 70% HP. The damage this ability stays the same but double-hit can be dangerous to more squishy builds, so don't stand on the intersection of two lines. Lilith turns to face the player and then summons two shadow clones of herself. After a brief delay, Lilith and her clones jump backwards while launching forward a wide wave of demonic spikes that deals lethal damage on contact. The easiest way to dodge this attack is to simply move behind Lilith while she is preparing the wave. If Lilith's back is to the edge of the arena and you can't stand behind her, you need to run backwards and to the side to get out of the way. In some cases the wave can be aimed directly through the arena's center, making it impossible to dodge without leaving the circle. To prevent this from happening, never stand between Lilith and the center of the arena when you both are close to the edge. Lilith leaps upward, briefly leaving the arena. After a 1.2 second delay, 3 warning markers are created on the ground: one directly next to the player and two more to the sides and slightly back. One second later, Lilith's shadow clones come crashing down and launch 3 narrow waves of demonic spikes from the position of the markers. Finally, Lilith herself comes down, launching the 4th wave down the middle lane from further back. This version is available at all times. As soon as you see Lilith crouch before her jump, start moving to the edge of the arena. If you get there fast enough, all the launching spots of the waves will be inside the circle. Then all you have to do is run to the opposite side until you get behind the 4th warning marker. This way you are never in a path of any waves and you are also right next to the Lilith's landing spot, ready to deal damage. If you fail to get to the edge of the arena in time, the safe areas may land outside the circle. In that case you have to dodge the attack the hard way. Move to the side of the first marker to let the wave pass you by. As soon as it passes, immediately get behind it to avoid the incoming side wave. Again, as soon as side wave passes, go behind it again to avoid the final wave coming down the middle. Keep in mind that the hitbox of the waves is slightly in front of them (which is further exacerbated by your latency), meaning that you will get hit before the wave even touches you. On the bright side, that also means that back side of the wave is quite safe: if you approach a wave from behind you can literally stand on top of the spikes without taking damage. Lilith leaps upward, briefly leaving the arena. After a 1.2 second delay, 3 warning markers are created on the ground: one directly next to the player and two more to the sides and far behind. One second later, Lilith's shadow clones come crashing down and launch 3 narrow waves of demonic spikes from the position of the markers. Finally Lilith herself comes down, launching the 4th wave down the middle lane from further back. This version is available when Lilith is below 70% HP. The exact same strategy can be used for this version: run to the edge, wait for marker, run to to opposite side to get behind the 4th wave. Since you always stay in the middle lane you don't have to worry about side waves no matter what direction they go. If you fail to get to the edge of the arena in time, you need to dodge differently. Get behind the first marker and then run behind the wave as closely as you can. When the side waves pass by, get out of the middle to avoid the incoming last wave. If the first marker is at the edge of the circle and you can't get behind it, simply run backwards and to the side to get behind one of the side waves. In this version, there are 3 waves going along the sides of a triangle in clockwise direction. Lilith herself comes down in the center of the triangle, dealing lethal damage in large circular AoE. This version is available when Lilith is below 40% HP. The general method of dodging remains the same: you need to get to one side of the circle so that the attack is aimed off-center, and then quickly dash to the safe area on the opposite site. Keep in mind that that the waves continue traveling past the vertices of the triangle so the to be safe you need to be completely outside it. Unlike the previous two versions, this attack leaves you with less time to react since you need to get out of the central AoE quickly. If you fail to get to the edge of the arena in time, there might be no safe zones at all and then only Invulnerability can save you. This version also has only 3 first waves from the second version. Instead of launching 4th wave down the middle, Lilith comes down directly next to the player, dealing lethal damage in large circular AoE. This version is available when Lilith is below 40% HP. The general method of dodging remains the same: you need to get to one side of the circle so that the attack is aimed off-center, and then quickly dash to the safe area on the opposite site. If you stay in the middle lane while doing that, don't forget about incoming wave that will come a few seconds later. Move left or right when the side waves pass you. If you fail to get to the edge of the arena in time, there might be no safe zones at all and then only Invulnerability can save you. Lilith plunges her tail into the ground while siphoning blood out of the player at the same time, dealing unavoidable damage and creating 8 Dancing Blood Orbs going around the player in two concentric circles. After a brief delay an explosion of blood goes off next to the player dealing damage and creating a new Blood Orb in the center. All previously created Blood Orbs caught in the explosion are destroyed. Dancing Blood Orbs deal minor damage and make the player Vulnerable for 2.5 seconds upon impact. After orbiting the player's original position for 5 seconds, Dancing Blood Orbs swiftly fly out of the arena. In this phase, Blood Orbs are not enemies but obstacles on the map. Stepping into a Blood Orb deals low damage over time to the player and slows them. During certain attacks in this phase, Blood Orbs create deadly Red Souls that chase down the player. If Lilith is Staggered, all Blood Orbs except two (selected at random) are destroyed. This attack applies a stacking debuff to the player, which increases its damage by 2% per stack. The initial hit and the blood explosion apply 2 stacks and each Dancing Blood Orb applies 1 stack on hit. The initial hit is unavoidable. Its damage grows over time, so you need to have enough DPS to end the fight before you accumulate too many stacks of the debuff. The explosion deals high damage but it's easy to dodge with Evade if you remember it's coming. This version of the attack does the same initial damage and creates Dancing Blood Orbs, but instead of creating a single blood explosion next to the player 4 explosions happen in different corners of the arena and 4 Blood Orbs are created. This version is used at the beginning of the second phase when there are no active Blood Orbs on the arena. It can be skipped completely if you manage to take Lilith below 85% health before she spawns them, making this entire phase significantly easier. Lilith strikes the player 1-3 times with her tail. Similar to first phase, the damage of this attack is so low that most builds can just facetank it and use it as an opportunity to deal damage. Lilith flies up into the air and pulls all enemies towards herself while slowing them for 3 seconds. At the same time, she summons 4-6 (depending on her HP) Children of Lilith. After a 2 second delay, Lilith slams down onto the ground, dealing lethal damage in a large circle. Children of Lilith are a ghoul type enemies who pose no threat on their own but can become a source of Souls during certain attacks. If you get hit by the pull + slow you won't be able to get out of the AoE by just running. You need to use an ability to prevent the pull or to remove the slow. Alternatively, you can use a mobility skill or 2-3 Evade charges to get out even while slowed. After dodging, kill the Children before continuing to fight Lilith. Lilith lets out a scream, knocking the player back. After that, Lilith dashes towards the player and shoots a three-pronged fork of shadows at the player, which deals heavy damage. Then she does this dash + fork combo a second time. At the same time, a shadow clone of Lilith is created nearby, which mimics her initial scream and two fork attacks with a 1 second delay. After all 4 forks are shot, Lilith slams the ground near player's position, releasing a massive shadow explosion that deals lethal damage. If Lilith is killed or Staggered during this attack, the shadow clone will continue acting on its own. Since Lilith's death animation is very long, you will receive no rewards for double KO. Very tanky builds can survive a single hit by a fork, but most have to dodge this attack entirely. To do that, move away from Lilith and run in a large circle. Each fork's middle prong is always aimed directly at you, so you will always dodge it as long as you move laterally.

After a brief delay, she comes back flying across the entire battlefield, covering the ground behind her in a thick layer of cursed blood. After a 3 second delay, the blood ignites, dealing lethal damage to all enemies caught in it for the next 2 seconds.

It's recommended to focus on dodging the incoming Death From Above first and killing Volatile Bloods second. Since Volatile Bloods take 12 seconds to detonate, you have plenty of time to kill it without the threat of a one-shot hanging over you. When Lilith's health goes below 40%, she will finish her attack and summon 3 Oppressors. Same as the first minion phase, she will spam use Death From Above as long as her minions live. This phase is not very different from the first one. Now there are 3 minions instead of 2 but they pose little threat and all the danger is coming from now further upgraded Death From Above. Our strategy stays the same: focus on dodging first and killing second. After the minions die, the fight continues with more improvements to Lilith's attacks: During this stage Lilith will simply use Death From Above after every 2-3 attacks giving you little time to deal damage. Stay at the edge of the arena at all times to make dodging easier and slowly work through her HP bar. When Lilith's HP hits 0, the circle created at the start of the fight will disappear and 20 seconds later Echo of Lilith, Mother of Mankind will spawn in the center. Lilith opens up the fight with a semi-fixed sequence of attacks: After that she behaves similar to her first phase. She casts Blood Orb Creation whenever its 15s cooldown is ready and otherwise randomly chooses between Melee Combo, Flight (~20s cooldown), and Shadow Clone (~20s cooldown). During this part of the fight, the only threatening attack Lilith has is Shadow Clone, but with plenty of space to dodge it, you can always run in a big circle and be completely fine. Instead, you should focus at dealing damage and managing Blood Orbs. When the Blood Orb Creation is coming up, move next to (or even inside of) one of the existing Blood Orbs to make sure that their numbers don't increase. Staggering Lilith at this stage is also beneficial as it will destroy some of the Blood Orbs. Alternatively, you can just run to the top of the arena to spawn new Blood Orbs, as this section of the arena will soon be destroyed. This, however, makes the next phase transition very hard to survive, so only do this if you have an Invulnerability skill to help you. After Lilith's HP falls below 85% she will finish her current attack and use Flight (bottom to top). After that, she performs a special move (Lilith can't be Staggered during this time) where she uses her wings to destroy part of the arena. This section overlaps with the safe zone of previously used Flight and players standing on it take minor damage over time. 6 seconds later, the cut-off section crumbles down into the abyss, instantly killing all players standing on it. While the platform is crumbling and for 2 second after, Blood Orbs shoot Souls at the player. 2 Souls are created each second, regardless of the number of currently active Blood Orbs. Souls move at ~133% Movement Speed and home in on their target, but their turn speed is very low, making it possible to sidestep them. Souls deal heavy damage on contact. After the platform is broken, Lilith teleports to the center of arena and uses Ground Slam. Dodging all these attacks can be tricky but it becomes much easier if you can outrun the Souls. Then you just have to run in a large circle, timing it in such a way that you enter the crumbling platform right before the blood on the floor starts burning, and then leave it before it falls down, all without stopping. In this case, you only have to worry about the Souls coming straight at you and you Evade or simply take a step to the side to dodge them. Be aware that the pull from the Ground Slam attack will happen while there's still some Souls out, so you need to make sure that there are no Souls between you and arena's center when it happens (or simply use Unstoppable ability to prevent the pull). The second stage of the fight is no different from the first one, but now Lilith has one more ability to choose from: Ground Slam. The next stage begins when Lilith HP falls below 60% mark. Lilith will once again open up with Flight (bottom left to top right) and then will start breaking off the corner of the platform. Unlike the first time, the safe zone of Flight doesn't perfectly overlap with the crumbling platform and there's some burning blood in the left corner of it. There's nothing different in the way you dodge this attack but it's a bit more difficult because the safe zone and the arena itself is now smaller. After the platform is broken, Lilith will teleport to the center and use Ground Slam. During this stage of the fight, Lilith doesn't gain any new abilities but she gets some upgrades: When Lilith falls below 30% HP, she will break the last corner of the platform, starting with Flight (bottom right to top left), then platform break with all the bells whistles and Souls. As she destroys the last platform, she will cast Shadow Clone. After this, the fight continues but Lilith now has no cooldown on her Flight ability and will often use it twice in a row in opposite directions, forcing you to run from one end of the arena to the other and stand in a tiny safe zone while dodging all the Souls coming for you. On top of that, the arena itself is so small now that you barely have space to dodge her Ground Slam and Shadow Clone attacks. Needless to say, staying alive and dealing damage is extremely difficult so it's recommended to Stagger Lilith either right before or right after the last transition and then deal as much damage as possible to shorten this stage of the fight or even outright kill her. The above description of the fight tells you what happens if you slowly and steadily deal damage to Lilith and she has plenty of time to perform all her special attacks. Things can be very different if your damage is overwhelmingly high and certain parts of the fight can be outright skipped. For example, if you deal 60% of Lilith's HP in one hit at the beginning of the fight, she will go up and then come down to summon Oppressors, and you will never have to fight any Enforcers. Now, most builds can't do that kind of damage but that's where Stagger comes in. Staggering Lilith lets you deal damage to her for 5 seconds uninterrupted and many builds can deal serious damage during that timeframe. If you Stagger her before she gets below 70% HP and then kill her before Stagger ends, you skip the most difficult parts of the first phase. If you manage to build stagger fast enough to Stagger her during the opening sequence of attacks, then you can finish the fight without dodging once. Depending on your damage output you can aim to stagger her at different HP thresholds: To manipulate the moment when Stagger happens you need to adjust the amount of stagger damage your build deals. There's two ways to do that: If you lack the damage to skip parts of the fight within one stagger, you can swap your gear during the fight. For example, you can use to build up Stagger and then switch to offensive gloves and during the Stagger. Reviewed by"

If Lilith is killed or Staggered during this attack, the shadow clone will continue acting on its own. Since Lilith's death animation is very long, you will receive no rewards for double KO. Very tanky builds can survive a single hit by a fork, but most have to dodge this attack entirely. To do that, move away from Lilith and run in a large circle. Each fork's middle prong is always aimed directly at you, so you will always dodge it as long as you move laterally. In doing so, you risk running into one of the side prongs, so you need to either be far enough away from Lilith or slow down a bit after you dodge the middle one. When Lilith raises her wings before the final part of the attack, move quickly to the opposite side of the arena to avoid the explosion. Lilith flies up and leaves the arena. After a brief delay, she comes back flying across the entire battlefield, covering the ground behind her in a thick layer of cursed blood. After a 3 second delay, the blood ignites, dealing lethal damage to all enemies caught in it for the next 2 seconds. There's always a safe zone at the side of the arena where Lilith finishes her flight. This attack is trivial to dodge on it's own and only becomes dangerous when combined with Souls chasing down the player. Remember that no damage is done until the blood catches fire, so you don't need to rush into the safe zone immediately. After player enters the arena, Lilith will drop down in the center, knocking the player back and creating a Circle of Doom that limits the size of the playable area. Stepping outside of the circle will deal extremely high damage over time to the player. The fight always starts with the fixed sequence of attacks: After that she will select one of 5 attacks available to her: Lilith will always prioritize Blood Orb Creation if it's not on cooldown. She will never do Melee Combo more than twice in a row. Otherwise the attacks are selected at random. During this stage of the fight, Lilith has long cooldowns on her high-damage attacks, giving you plenty of time to damage her and/or apply Stagger. Be ready to dodge Wave of Spikes or Death From Above when they come and you should be able to get through this stage without much trouble. When Lilith's health goes below 70%, she will finish her attack and summon 2 Enforcers. After that, she will continuously use Death From Above as long as at least one of the Enforcers is alive (but no less than 2 times). Each Enforcer will leave behind 2 Volatile Bloods and  6 Health Potion charges upon death. Enforcers themselves deal almost no damage. Your primary focus should be on dodging the Death From Above spam while killing them. Stay at the edge of the arena and let the Enforcers come to you. Be mindful of their pull attack as it can move you into the one-shot attacks from Lilith. If your build is not great at cleaning up Volatile Blood, try to kill the minions one-by-one and kill the Blood in-between. After you kill both minions, the camera returns to the normal zoom level and the second stage of the fight begins. Lilith's abilities are upgraded: Her attacks, in general, will follow this pattern: Your best strategy is to focus on dodging during steps 1-3 and doing damage during step 4. Since her Blood Orb Creation now has reduced cooldown and still has highest priority, the attack in step 2 will often be Blood Orb Creation. It's recommended to focus on dodging the incoming Death From Above first and killing Volatile Bloods second. Since Volatile Bloods take 12 seconds to detonate, you have plenty of time to kill it without the threat of a one-shot hanging over you. When Lilith's health goes below 40%, she will finish her attack and summon 3 Oppressors. Same as the first minion phase, she will spam use Death From Above as long as her minions live. This phase is not very different from the first one. Now there are 3 minions instead of 2 but they pose little threat and all the danger is coming from now further upgraded Death From Above. Our strategy stays the same: focus on dodging first and killing second. After the minions die, the fight continues with more improvements to Lilith's attacks: During this stage Lilith will simply use Death From Above after every 2-3 attacks giving you little time to deal damage. Stay at the edge of the arena at all times to make dodging easier and slowly work through her HP bar. When Lilith's HP hits 0, the circle created at the start of the fight will disappear and 20 seconds later Echo of Lilith, Mother of Mankind will spawn in the center. Lilith opens up the fight with a semi-fixed sequence of attacks: After that she behaves similar to her first phase. She casts Blood Orb Creation whenever its 15s cooldown is ready and otherwise randomly chooses between Melee Combo, Flight (~20s cooldown), and Shadow Clone (~20s cooldown). During this part of the fight, the only threatening attack Lilith has is Shadow Clone, but with plenty of space to dodge it, you can always run in a big circle and be completely fine. Instead, you should focus at dealing damage and managing Blood Orbs. When the Blood Orb Creation is coming up, move next to (or even inside of) one of the existing Blood Orbs to make sure that their numbers don't increase. Staggering Lilith at this stage is also beneficial as it will destroy some of the Blood Orbs. Alternatively, you can just run to the top of the arena to spawn new Blood Orbs, as this section of the arena will soon be destroyed. This, however, makes the next phase transition very hard to survive, so only do this if you have an Invulnerability skill to help you. After Lilith's HP falls below 85% she will finish her current attack and use Flight (bottom to top). After that, she performs a special move (Lilith can't be Staggered during this time) where she uses her wings to destroy part of the arena. This section overlaps with the safe zone of previously used Flight and players standing on it take minor damage over time. 6 seconds later, the cut-off section crumbles down into the abyss, instantly killing all players standing on it. While the platform is crumbling and for 2 second after, Blood Orbs shoot Souls at the player. 2 Souls are created each second, regardless of the number of currently active Blood Orbs. Souls move at ~133% Movement Speed and home in on their target, but their turn speed is very low, making it possible to sidestep them. Souls deal heavy damage on contact. After the platform is broken, Lilith teleports to the center of arena and uses Ground Slam. Dodging all these attacks can be tricky but it becomes much easier if you can outrun the Souls. Then you just have to run in a large circle, timing it in such a way that you enter the crumbling platform right before the blood on the floor starts burning, and then leave it before it falls down, all without stopping. In this case, you only have to worry about the Souls coming straight at you and you Evade or simply take a step to the side to dodge them. Be aware that the pull from the Ground Slam attack will happen while there's still some Souls out, so you need to make sure that there are no Souls between you and arena's center when it happens (or simply use Unstoppable ability to prevent the pull). The second stage of the fight is no different from the first one, but now Lilith has one more ability to choose from: Ground Slam. The next stage begins when Lilith HP falls below 60% mark. Lilith will once again open up with Flight (bottom left to top right) and then will start breaking off the corner of the platform. Unlike the first time, the safe zone of Flight doesn't perfectly overlap with the crumbling platform and there's some burning blood in the left corner of it. There's nothing different in the way you dodge this attack but it's a bit more difficult because the safe zone and the arena itself is now smaller. After the platform is broken, Lilith will teleport to the center and use Ground Slam. During this stage of the fight, Lilith doesn't gain any new abilities but she gets some upgrades: When Lilith falls below 30% HP, she will break the last corner of the platform, starting with Flight (bottom right to top left), then platform break with all the bells whistles and Souls. As she destroys the last platform, she will cast Shadow Clone. After this, the fight continues but Lilith now has no cooldown on her Flight ability and will often use it twice in a row in opposite directions, forcing you to run from one end of the arena to the other and stand in a tiny safe zone while dodging all the Souls coming for you. On top of that, the arena itself is so small now that you barely have space to dodge her Ground Slam and Shadow Clone attacks. Needless to say, staying alive and dealing damage is extremely difficult so it's recommended to Stagger Lilith either right before or right after the last transition and then deal as much damage as possible to shorten this stage of the fight or even outright kill her. The above description of the fight tells you what happens if you slowly and steadily deal damage to Lilith and she has plenty of time to perform all her special attacks. Things can be very different if your damage is overwhelmingly high and certain parts of the fight can be outright skipped. For example, if you deal 60% of Lilith's HP in one hit at the beginning of the fight, she will go up and then come down to summon Oppressors, and you will never have to fight any Enforcers. Now, most builds can't do that kind of damage but that's where Stagger comes in. Staggering Lilith lets you deal damage to her for 5 seconds uninterrupted and many builds can deal serious damage during that timeframe. If you Stagger her before she gets below 70% HP and then kill her before Stagger ends, you skip the most difficult parts of the first phase. If you manage to build stagger fast enough to Stagger her during the opening sequence of attacks, then you can finish the fight without dodging once. Depending on your damage output you can aim to stagger her at different HP thresholds: To manipulate the moment when Stagger happens you need to adjust the amount of stagger damage your build deals. There's two ways to do that: If you lack the damage to skip parts of the fight within one stagger, you can swap your gear during the fight. For example, you can use to build up Stagger and then switch to offensive gloves and during the Stagger. Reviewed by"

    "heading": "Second Platform Break",
    "content": "Lilith turns to face the player and then summons two shadow clones of herself. After a brief delay, Lilith and her clones jump backwards while launching forward a wide wave of demonic spikes that deals lethal damage on contact. The easiest way to dodge this attack is to simply move behind Lilith while she is preparing the wave. If Lilith's back is to the edge of the arena and you can't stand behind her, you need to run backwards and to the side to get out of the way. In some cases the wave can be aimed directly through the arena's center, making it impossible to dodge without leaving the circle. To prevent this from happening, never stand between Lilith and the center of the arena when you both are close to the edge. Lilith leaps upward, briefly leaving the arena. After a 1.2 second delay, 3 warning markers are created on the ground: one directly next to the player and two more to the sides and slightly back. One second later, Lilith's shadow clones come crashing down and launch 3 narrow waves of demonic spikes from the position of the markers. Finally, Lilith herself comes down, launching the 4th wave down the middle lane from further back. This version is available at all times. As soon as you see Lilith crouch before her jump, start moving to the edge of the arena. If you get there fast enough, all the launching spots of the waves will be inside the circle. Then all you have to do is run to the opposite side until you get behind the 4th warning marker. This way you are never in a path of any waves and you are also right next to the Lilith's landing spot, ready to deal damage. If you fail to get to the edge of the arena in time, the safe areas may land outside the circle. In that case you have to dodge the attack the hard way. Move to the side of the first marker to let the wave pass you by. As soon as it passes, immediately get behind it to avoid the incoming side wave. Again, as soon as side wave passes, go behind it again to avoid the final wave coming down the middle. Keep in mind that the hitbox of the waves is slightly in front of them (which is further exacerbated by your latency), meaning that you will get hit before the wave even touches you. On the bright side, that also means that back side of the wave is quite safe: if you approach a wave from behind you can literally stand on top of the spikes without taking damage. Lilith leaps upward, briefly leaving the arena. After a 1.2 second delay, 3 warning markers are created on the ground: one directly next to the player and two more to the sides and far behind. One second later, Lilith's shadow clones come crashing down and launch 3 narrow waves of demonic spikes from the position of the markers. Finally Lilith herself comes down, launching the 4th wave down the middle lane from further back. This version is available when Lilith is below 70% HP. The exact same strategy can be used for this version: run to the edge, wait for marker, run to to opposite side to get behind the 4th wave. Since you always stay in the middle lane you don't have to worry about side waves no matter what direction they go. If you fail to get to the edge of the arena in time, you need to dodge differently. Get behind the first marker and then run behind the wave as closely as you can. When the side waves pass by, get out of the middle to avoid the incoming last wave. If the first marker is at the edge of the circle and you can't get behind it, simply run backwards and to the side to get behind one of the side waves. In this version, there are 3 waves going along the sides of a triangle in clockwise direction. Lilith herself comes down in the center of the triangle, dealing lethal damage in large circular AoE. This version is available when Lilith is below 40% HP. The general method of dodging remains the same: you need to get to one side of the circle so that the attack is aimed off-center, and then quickly dash to the safe area on the opposite site. Keep in mind that that the waves continue traveling past the vertices of the triangle so the to be safe you need to be completely outside it. Unlike the previous two versions, this attack leaves you with less time to react since you need to get out of the central AoE quickly. If you fail to get to the edge of the arena in time, there might be no safe zones at all and then only Invulnerability can save you. This version also has only 3 first waves from the second version. Instead of launching 4th wave down the middle, Lilith comes down directly next to the player, dealing lethal damage in large circular AoE. This version is available when Lilith is below 40% HP. The general method of dodging remains the same: you need to get to one side of the circle so that the attack is aimed off-center, and then quickly dash to the safe area on the opposite site. If you stay in the middle lane while doing that, don't forget about incoming wave that will come a few seconds later. Move left or right when the side waves pass you. If you fail to get to the edge of the arena in time, there might be no safe zones at all and then only Invulnerability can save you. Lilith plunges her tail into the ground while siphoning blood out of the player at the same time, dealing unavoidable damage and creating 8 Dancing Blood Orbs going around the player in two concentric circles. After a brief delay an explosion of blood goes off next to the player dealing damage and creating a new Blood Orb in the center. All previously created Blood Orbs caught in the explosion are destroyed. Dancing Blood Orbs deal minor damage and make the player Vulnerable for 2.5 seconds upon impact. After orbiting the player's original position for 5 seconds, Dancing Blood Orbs swiftly fly out of the arena. In this phase, Blood Orbs are not enemies but obstacles on the map. Stepping into a Blood Orb deals low damage over time to the player and slows them. During certain attacks in this phase, Blood Orbs create deadly Red Souls that chase down the player. If Lilith is Staggered, all Blood Orbs except two (selected at random) are destroyed. This attack applies a stacking debuff to the player, which increases its damage by 2% per stack. The initial hit and the blood explosion apply 2 stacks and each Dancing Blood Orb applies 1 stack on hit. The initial hit is unavoidable. Its damage grows over time, so you need to have enough DPS to end the fight before you accumulate too many stacks of the debuff. The explosion deals high damage but it's easy to dodge with Evade if you remember it's coming. This version of the attack does the same initial damage and creates Dancing Blood Orbs, but instead of creating a single blood explosion next to the player 4 explosions happen in different corners of the arena and 4 Blood Orbs are created. This version is used at the beginning of the second phase when there are no active Blood Orbs on the arena. It can be skipped completely if you manage to take Lilith below 85% health before she spawns them, making this entire phase significantly easier. Lilith strikes the player 1-3 times with her tail. Similar to first phase, the damage of this attack is so low that most builds can just facetank it and use it as an opportunity to deal damage. Lilith flies up into the air and pulls all enemies towards herself while slowing them for 3 seconds. At the same time, she summons 4-6 (depending on her HP) Children of Lilith. After a 2 second delay, Lilith slams down onto the ground, dealing lethal damage in a large circle. Children of Lilith are a ghoul type enemies who pose no threat on their own but can become a source of Souls during certain attacks. If you get hit by the pull + slow you won't be able to get out of the AoE by just running. You need to use an ability to prevent the pull or to remove the slow. Alternatively, you can use a mobility skill or 2-3 Evade charges to get out even while slowed. After dodging, kill the Children before continuing to fight Lilith. Lilith lets out a scream, knocking the player back. After that, Lilith dashes towards the player and shoots a three-pronged fork of shadows at the player, which deals heavy damage. Then she does this dash + fork combo a second time. At the same time, a shadow clone of Lilith is created nearby, which mimics her initial scream and two fork attacks with a 1 second delay. After all 4 forks are shot, Lilith slams the ground near player's position, releasing a massive shadow explosion that deals lethal damage. If Lilith is killed or Staggered during this attack, the shadow clone will continue acting on its own. Since Lilith's death animation is very long, you will receive no rewards for double KO. Very tanky builds can survive a single hit by a fork, but most have to dodge this attack entirely. To do that, move away from Lilith and run in a large circle. Each fork's middle prong is always aimed directly at you, so you will always dodge it as long as you move laterally. In doing so, you risk running into one of the side prongs, so you need to either be far enough away from Lilith or slow down a bit after you dodge the middle one. When Lilith raises her wings before the final part of the attack, move quickly to the opposite side of the arena to avoid the explosion. Lilith flies up and leaves the arena. After a brief delay, she comes back flying across the entire battlefield, covering the ground behind her in a thick layer of cursed blood. After a 3 second delay, the blood ignites, dealing lethal damage to all enemies caught in it for the next 2 seconds. There's always a safe zone at the side of the arena where Lilith finishes her flight. This attack is trivial to dodge on it's own and only becomes dangerous when combined with Souls chasing down the player. Remember that no damage is done until the blood catches fire, so you don't need to rush into the safe zone immediately. After player enters the arena, Lilith will drop down in the center, knocking the player back and creating a Circle of Doom that limits the size of the playable area. Stepping outside of the circle will deal extremely high damage over time to the player. The fight always starts with the fixed sequence of attacks: After that she will select one of 5 attacks available to her: Lilith will always prioritize Blood Orb Creation if it's not on cooldown. She will never do Melee Combo more than twice in a row. Otherwise the attacks are selected at random. During this stage of the fight, Lilith has long cooldowns on her high-damage attacks, giving you plenty of time to damage her and/or apply Stagger. Be ready to dodge Wave of Spikes or Death From Above when they come and you should be able to get through this stage without much trouble. When Lilith's health goes below 70%, she will finish her attack and summon 2 Enforcers. After that, she will continuously use Death From Above as long as at least one of the Enforcers is alive (but no less than 2 times). Each Enforcer will leave behind 2 Volatile Bloods and  6 Health Potion charges upon death. Enforcers themselves deal almost no damage. Your primary focus should be on dodging the Death From Above spam while killing them. Stay at the edge of the arena and let the Enforcers come to you. Be mindful of their pull attack as it can move you into the one-shot attacks from Lilith. If your build is not great at cleaning up Volatile Blood, try to kill the minions one-by-one and kill the Blood in-between. After you kill both minions, the camera returns to the normal zoom level and the second stage of the fight begins. Lilith's abilities are upgraded: Her attacks, in general, will follow this pattern: Your best strategy is to focus on dodging during steps 1-3 and doing damage during step 4. Since her Blood Orb Creation now has reduced cooldown and still has highest priority, the attack in step 2 will often be Blood Orb Creation. It's recommended to focus on dodging the incoming Death From Above first and killing Volatile Bloods second. Since Volatile Bloods take 12 seconds to detonate, you have plenty of time to kill it without the threat of a one-shot hanging over you.

Each fork's middle prong is always aimed directly at you, so you will always dodge it as long as you move laterally. In doing so, you risk running into one of the side prongs, so you need to either be far enough away from Lilith or slow down a bit after you dodge the middle one. When Lilith raises her wings before the final part of the attack, move quickly to the opposite side of the arena to avoid the explosion. Lilith flies up and leaves the arena. After a brief delay, she comes back flying across the entire battlefield, covering the ground behind her in a thick layer of cursed blood. After a 3 second delay, the blood ignites, dealing lethal damage to all enemies caught in it for the next 2 seconds. There's always a safe zone at the side of the arena where Lilith finishes her flight. This attack is trivial to dodge on it's own and only becomes dangerous when combined with Souls chasing down the player. Remember that no damage is done until the blood catches fire, so you don't need to rush into the safe zone immediately. After player enters the arena, Lilith will drop down in the center, knocking the player back and creating a Circle of Doom that limits the size of the playable area. Stepping outside of the circle will deal extremely high damage over time to the player. The fight always starts with the fixed sequence of attacks: After that she will select one of 5 attacks available to her: Lilith will always prioritize Blood Orb Creation if it's not on cooldown. She will never do Melee Combo more than twice in a row. Otherwise the attacks are selected at random. During this stage of the fight, Lilith has long cooldowns on her high-damage attacks, giving you plenty of time to damage her and/or apply Stagger. Be ready to dodge Wave of Spikes or Death From Above when they come and you should be able to get through this stage without much trouble. When Lilith's health goes below 70%, she will finish her attack and summon 2 Enforcers. After that, she will continuously use Death From Above as long as at least one of the Enforcers is alive (but no less than 2 times). Each Enforcer will leave behind 2 Volatile Bloods and  6 Health Potion charges upon death. Enforcers themselves deal almost no damage. Your primary focus should be on dodging the Death From Above spam while killing them. Stay at the edge of the arena and let the Enforcers come to you. Be mindful of their pull attack as it can move you into the one-shot attacks from Lilith. If your build is not great at cleaning up Volatile Blood, try to kill the minions one-by-one and kill the Blood in-between. After you kill both minions, the camera returns to the normal zoom level and the second stage of the fight begins. Lilith's abilities are upgraded: Her attacks, in general, will follow this pattern: Your best strategy is to focus on dodging during steps 1-3 and doing damage during step 4. Since her Blood Orb Creation now has reduced cooldown and still has highest priority, the attack in step 2 will often be Blood Orb Creation. It's recommended to focus on dodging the incoming Death From Above first and killing Volatile Bloods second. Since Volatile Bloods take 12 seconds to detonate, you have plenty of time to kill it without the threat of a one-shot hanging over you. When Lilith's health goes below 40%, she will finish her attack and summon 3 Oppressors. Same as the first minion phase, she will spam use Death From Above as long as her minions live. This phase is not very different from the first one. Now there are 3 minions instead of 2 but they pose little threat and all the danger is coming from now further upgraded Death From Above. Our strategy stays the same: focus on dodging first and killing second. After the minions die, the fight continues with more improvements to Lilith's attacks: During this stage Lilith will simply use Death From Above after every 2-3 attacks giving you little time to deal damage. Stay at the edge of the arena at all times to make dodging easier and slowly work through her HP bar. When Lilith's HP hits 0, the circle created at the start of the fight will disappear and 20 seconds later Echo of Lilith, Mother of Mankind will spawn in the center. Lilith opens up the fight with a semi-fixed sequence of attacks: After that she behaves similar to her first phase. She casts Blood Orb Creation whenever its 15s cooldown is ready and otherwise randomly chooses between Melee Combo, Flight (~20s cooldown), and Shadow Clone (~20s cooldown). During this part of the fight, the only threatening attack Lilith has is Shadow Clone, but with plenty of space to dodge it, you can always run in a big circle and be completely fine. Instead, you should focus at dealing damage and managing Blood Orbs. When the Blood Orb Creation is coming up, move next to (or even inside of) one of the existing Blood Orbs to make sure that their numbers don't increase. Staggering Lilith at this stage is also beneficial as it will destroy some of the Blood Orbs. Alternatively, you can just run to the top of the arena to spawn new Blood Orbs, as this section of the arena will soon be destroyed. This, however, makes the next phase transition very hard to survive, so only do this if you have an Invulnerability skill to help you. After Lilith's HP falls below 85% she will finish her current attack and use Flight (bottom to top). After that, she performs a special move (Lilith can't be Staggered during this time) where she uses her wings to destroy part of the arena. This section overlaps with the safe zone of previously used Flight and players standing on it take minor damage over time. 6 seconds later, the cut-off section crumbles down into the abyss, instantly killing all players standing on it. While the platform is crumbling and for 2 second after, Blood Orbs shoot Souls at the player. 2 Souls are created each second, regardless of the number of currently active Blood Orbs. Souls move at ~133% Movement Speed and home in on their target, but their turn speed is very low, making it possible to sidestep them. Souls deal heavy damage on contact. After the platform is broken, Lilith teleports to the center of arena and uses Ground Slam. Dodging all these attacks can be tricky but it becomes much easier if you can outrun the Souls. Then you just have to run in a large circle, timing it in such a way that you enter the crumbling platform right before the blood on the floor starts burning, and then leave it before it falls down, all without stopping. In this case, you only have to worry about the Souls coming straight at you and you Evade or simply take a step to the side to dodge them. Be aware that the pull from the Ground Slam attack will happen while there's still some Souls out, so you need to make sure that there are no Souls between you and arena's center when it happens (or simply use Unstoppable ability to prevent the pull). The second stage of the fight is no different from the first one, but now Lilith has one more ability to choose from: Ground Slam. The next stage begins when Lilith HP falls below 60% mark. Lilith will once again open up with Flight (bottom left to top right) and then will start breaking off the corner of the platform. Unlike the first time, the safe zone of Flight doesn't perfectly overlap with the crumbling platform and there's some burning blood in the left corner of it. There's nothing different in the way you dodge this attack but it's a bit more difficult because the safe zone and the arena itself is now smaller. After the platform is broken, Lilith will teleport to the center and use Ground Slam. During this stage of the fight, Lilith doesn't gain any new abilities but she gets some upgrades: When Lilith falls below 30% HP, she will break the last corner of the platform, starting with Flight (bottom right to top left), then platform break with all the bells whistles and Souls. As she destroys the last platform, she will cast Shadow Clone. After this, the fight continues but Lilith now has no cooldown on her Flight ability and will often use it twice in a row in opposite directions, forcing you to run from one end of the arena to the other and stand in a tiny safe zone while dodging all the Souls coming for you. On top of that, the arena itself is so small now that you barely have space to dodge her Ground Slam and Shadow Clone attacks. Needless to say, staying alive and dealing damage is extremely difficult so it's recommended to Stagger Lilith either right before or right after the last transition and then deal as much damage as possible to shorten this stage of the fight or even outright kill her. The above description of the fight tells you what happens if you slowly and steadily deal damage to Lilith and she has plenty of time to perform all her special attacks. Things can be very different if your damage is overwhelmingly high and certain parts of the fight can be outright skipped. For example, if you deal 60% of Lilith's HP in one hit at the beginning of the fight, she will go up and then come down to summon Oppressors, and you will never have to fight any Enforcers. Now, most builds can't do that kind of damage but that's where Stagger comes in. Staggering Lilith lets you deal damage to her for 5 seconds uninterrupted and many builds can deal serious damage during that timeframe. If you Stagger her before she gets below 70% HP and then kill her before Stagger ends, you skip the most difficult parts of the first phase. If you manage to build stagger fast enough to Stagger her during the opening sequence of attacks, then you can finish the fight without dodging once. Depending on your damage output you can aim to stagger her at different HP thresholds: To manipulate the moment when Stagger happens you need to adjust the amount of stagger damage your build deals. There's two ways to do that: If you lack the damage to skip parts of the fight within one stagger, you can swap your gear during the fight. For example, you can use to build up Stagger and then switch to offensive gloves and during the Stagger. Reviewed by"

    "content": "Lilith leaps upward, briefly leaving the arena. After a 1.2 second delay, 3 warning markers are created on the ground: one directly next to the player and two more to the sides and slightly back. One second later, Lilith's shadow clones come crashing down and launch 3 narrow waves of demonic spikes from the position of the markers. Finally, Lilith herself comes down, launching the 4th wave down the middle lane from further back. This version is available at all times. As soon as you see Lilith crouch before her jump, start moving to the edge of the arena. If you get there fast enough, all the launching spots of the waves will be inside the circle. Then all you have to do is run to the opposite side until you get behind the 4th warning marker. This way you are never in a path of any waves and you are also right next to the Lilith's landing spot, ready to deal damage. If you fail to get to the edge of the arena in time, the safe areas may land outside the circle. In that case you have to dodge the attack the hard way. Move to the side of the first marker to let the wave pass you by. As soon as it passes, immediately get behind it to avoid the incoming side wave. Again, as soon as side wave passes, go behind it again to avoid the final wave coming down the middle. Keep in mind that the hitbox of the waves is slightly in front of them (which is further exacerbated by your latency), meaning that you will get hit before the wave even touches you. On the bright side, that also means that back side of the wave is quite safe: if you approach a wave from behind you can literally stand on top of the spikes without taking damage. Lilith leaps upward, briefly leaving the arena. After a 1.2 second delay, 3 warning markers are created on the ground: one directly next to the player and two more to the sides and far behind. One second later, Lilith's shadow clones come crashing down and launch 3 narrow waves of demonic spikes from the position of the markers. Finally Lilith herself comes down, launching the 4th wave down the middle lane from further back. This version is available when Lilith is below 70% HP. The exact same strategy can be used for this version: run to the edge, wait for marker, run to to opposite side to get behind the 4th wave. Since you always stay in the middle lane you don't have to worry about side waves no matter what direction they go. If you fail to get to the edge of the arena in time, you need to dodge differently. Get behind the first marker and then run behind the wave as closely as you can. When the side waves pass by, get out of the middle to avoid the incoming last wave. If the first marker is at the edge of the circle and you can't get behind it, simply run backwards and to the side to get behind one of the side waves. In this version, there are 3 waves going along the sides of a triangle in clockwise direction. Lilith herself comes down in the center of the triangle, dealing lethal damage in large circular AoE. This version is available when Lilith is below 40% HP. The general method of dodging remains the same: you need to get to one side of the circle so that the attack is aimed off-center, and then quickly dash to the safe area on the opposite site. Keep in mind that that the waves continue traveling past the vertices of the triangle so the to be safe you need to be completely outside it. Unlike the previous two versions, this attack leaves you with less time to react since you need to get out of the central AoE quickly. If you fail to get to the edge of the arena in time, there might be no safe zones at all and then only Invulnerability can save you. This version also has only 3 first waves from the second version. Instead of launching 4th wave down the middle, Lilith comes down directly next to the player, dealing lethal damage in large circular AoE. This version is available when Lilith is below 40% HP. The general method of dodging remains the same: you need to get to one side of the circle so that the attack is aimed off-center, and then quickly dash to the safe area on the opposite site. If you stay in the middle lane while doing that, don't forget about incoming wave that will come a few seconds later. Move left or right when the side waves pass you. If you fail to get to the edge of the arena in time, there might be no safe zones at all and then only Invulnerability can save you. Lilith plunges her tail into the ground while siphoning blood out of the player at the same time, dealing unavoidable damage and creating 8 Dancing Blood Orbs going around the player in two concentric circles. After a brief delay an explosion of blood goes off next to the player dealing damage and creating a new Blood Orb in the center. All previously created Blood Orbs caught in the explosion are destroyed. Dancing Blood Orbs deal minor damage and make the player Vulnerable for 2.5 seconds upon impact. After orbiting the player's original position for 5 seconds, Dancing Blood Orbs swiftly fly out of the arena. In this phase, Blood Orbs are not enemies but obstacles on the map. Stepping into a Blood Orb deals low damage over time to the player and slows them. During certain attacks in this phase, Blood Orbs create deadly Red Souls that chase down the player. If Lilith is Staggered, all Blood Orbs except two (selected at random) are destroyed. This attack applies a stacking debuff to the player, which increases its damage by 2% per stack. The initial hit and the blood explosion apply 2 stacks and each Dancing Blood Orb applies 1 stack on hit. The initial hit is unavoidable. Its damage grows over time, so you need to have enough DPS to end the fight before you accumulate too many stacks of the debuff. The explosion deals high damage but it's easy to dodge with Evade if you remember it's coming. This version of the attack does the same initial damage and creates Dancing Blood Orbs, but instead of creating a single blood explosion next to the player 4 explosions happen in different corners of the arena and 4 Blood Orbs are created. This version is used at the beginning of the second phase when there are no active Blood Orbs on the arena. It can be skipped completely if you manage to take Lilith below 85% health before she spawns them, making this entire phase significantly easier. Lilith strikes the player 1-3 times with her tail. Similar to first phase, the damage of this attack is so low that most builds can just facetank it and use it as an opportunity to deal damage. Lilith flies up into the air and pulls all enemies towards herself while slowing them for 3 seconds. At the same time, she summons 4-6 (depending on her HP) Children of Lilith. After a 2 second delay, Lilith slams down onto the ground, dealing lethal damage in a large circle. Children of Lilith are a ghoul type enemies who pose no threat on their own but can become a source of Souls during certain attacks. If you get hit by the pull + slow you won't be able to get out of the AoE by just running. You need to use an ability to prevent the pull or to remove the slow. Alternatively, you can use a mobility skill or 2-3 Evade charges to get out even while slowed. After dodging, kill the Children before continuing to fight Lilith. Lilith lets out a scream, knocking the player back. After that, Lilith dashes towards the player and shoots a three-pronged fork of shadows at the player, which deals heavy damage. Then she does this dash + fork combo a second time. At the same time, a shadow clone of Lilith is created nearby, which mimics her initial scream and two fork attacks with a 1 second delay. After all 4 forks are shot, Lilith slams the ground near player's position, releasing a massive shadow explosion that deals lethal damage. If Lilith is killed or Staggered during this attack, the shadow clone will continue acting on its own. Since Lilith's death animation is very long, you will receive no rewards for double KO. Very tanky builds can survive a single hit by a fork, but most have to dodge this attack entirely. To do that, move away from Lilith and run in a large circle.

After a 3 second delay, the blood ignites, dealing lethal damage to all enemies caught in it for the next 2 seconds.

Alternatively, you can use a mobility skill or 2-3 Evade charges to get out even while slowed. After dodging, kill the Children before continuing to fight Lilith. Lilith lets out a scream, knocking the player back. After that, Lilith dashes towards the player and shoots a three-pronged fork of shadows at the player, which deals heavy damage. Then she does this dash + fork combo a second time. At the same time, a shadow clone of Lilith is created nearby, which mimics her initial scream and two fork attacks with a 1 second delay. After all 4 forks are shot, Lilith slams the ground near player's position, releasing a massive shadow explosion that deals lethal damage. If Lilith is killed or Staggered during this attack, the shadow clone will continue acting on its own. Since Lilith's death animation is very long, you will receive no rewards for double KO. Very tanky builds can survive a single hit by a fork, but most have to dodge this attack entirely. To do that, move away from Lilith and run in a large circle. Each fork's middle prong is always aimed directly at you, so you will always dodge it as long as you move laterally. In doing so, you risk running into one of the side prongs, so you need to either be far enough away from Lilith or slow down a bit after you dodge the middle one. When Lilith raises her wings before the final part of the attack, move quickly to the opposite side of the arena to avoid the explosion. Lilith flies up and leaves the arena. After a brief delay, she comes back flying across the entire battlefield, covering the ground behind her in a thick layer of cursed blood. After a 3 second delay, the blood ignites, dealing lethal damage to all enemies caught in it for the next 2 seconds. There's always a safe zone at the side of the arena where Lilith finishes her flight. This attack is trivial to dodge on it's own and only becomes dangerous when combined with Souls chasing down the player. Remember that no damage is done until the blood catches fire, so you don't need to rush into the safe zone immediately. After player enters the arena, Lilith will drop down in the center, knocking the player back and creating a Circle of Doom that limits the size of the playable area. Stepping outside of the circle will deal extremely high damage over time to the player. The fight always starts with the fixed sequence of attacks: After that she will select one of 5 attacks available to her: Lilith will always prioritize Blood Orb Creation if it's not on cooldown. She will never do Melee Combo more than twice in a row. Otherwise the attacks are selected at random. During this stage of the fight, Lilith has long cooldowns on her high-damage attacks, giving you plenty of time to damage her and/or apply Stagger. Be ready to dodge Wave of Spikes or Death From Above when they come and you should be able to get through this stage without much trouble. When Lilith's health goes below 70%, she will finish her attack and summon 2 Enforcers. After that, she will continuously use Death From Above as long as at least one of the Enforcers is alive (but no less than 2 times). Each Enforcer will leave behind 2 Volatile Bloods and  6 Health Potion charges upon death. Enforcers themselves deal almost no damage. Your primary focus should be on dodging the Death From Above spam while killing them. Stay at the edge of the arena and let the Enforcers come to you. Be mindful of their pull attack as it can move you into the one-shot attacks from Lilith. If your build is not great at cleaning up Volatile Blood, try to kill the minions one-by-one and kill the Blood in-between. After you kill both minions, the camera returns to the normal zoom level and the second stage of the fight begins. Lilith's abilities are upgraded: Her attacks, in general, will follow this pattern: Your best strategy is to focus on dodging during steps 1-3 and doing damage during step 4. Since her Blood Orb Creation now has reduced cooldown and still has highest priority, the attack in step 2 will often be Blood Orb Creation. It's recommended to focus on dodging the incoming Death From Above first and killing Volatile Bloods second. Since Volatile Bloods take 12 seconds to detonate, you have plenty of time to kill it without the threat of a one-shot hanging over you. When Lilith's health goes below 40%, she will finish her attack and summon 3 Oppressors. Same as the first minion phase, she will spam use Death From Above as long as her minions live. This phase is not very different from the first one. Now there are 3 minions instead of 2 but they pose little threat and all the danger is coming from now further upgraded Death From Above. Our strategy stays the same: focus on dodging first and killing second. After the minions die, the fight continues with more improvements to Lilith's attacks: During this stage Lilith will simply use Death From Above after every 2-3 attacks giving you little time to deal damage. Stay at the edge of the arena at all times to make dodging easier and slowly work through her HP bar. When Lilith's HP hits 0, the circle created at the start of the fight will disappear and 20 seconds later Echo of Lilith, Mother of Mankind will spawn in the center. Lilith opens up the fight with a semi-fixed sequence of attacks: After that she behaves similar to her first phase. She casts Blood Orb Creation whenever its 15s cooldown is ready and otherwise randomly chooses between Melee Combo, Flight (~20s cooldown), and Shadow Clone (~20s cooldown). During this part of the fight, the only threatening attack Lilith has is Shadow Clone, but with plenty of space to dodge it, you can always run in a big circle and be completely fine. Instead, you should focus at dealing damage and managing Blood Orbs. When the Blood Orb Creation is coming up, move next to (or even inside of) one of the existing Blood Orbs to make sure that their numbers don't increase. Staggering Lilith at this stage is also beneficial as it will destroy some of the Blood Orbs. Alternatively, you can just run to the top of the arena to spawn new Blood Orbs, as this section of the arena will soon be destroyed. This, however, makes the next phase transition very hard to survive, so only do this if you have an Invulnerability skill to help you. After Lilith's HP falls below 85% she will finish her current attack and use Flight (bottom to top). After that, she performs a special move (Lilith can't be Staggered during this time) where she uses her wings to destroy part of the arena. This section overlaps with the safe zone of previously used Flight and players standing on it take minor damage over time. 6 seconds later, the cut-off section crumbles down into the abyss, instantly killing all players standing on it. While the platform is crumbling and for 2 second after, Blood Orbs shoot Souls at the player. 2 Souls are created each second, regardless of the number of currently active Blood Orbs. Souls move at ~133% Movement Speed and home in on their target, but their turn speed is very low, making it possible to sidestep them. Souls deal heavy damage on contact. After the platform is broken, Lilith teleports to the center of arena and uses Ground Slam. Dodging all these attacks can be tricky but it becomes much easier if you can outrun the Souls. Then you just have to run in a large circle, timing it in such a way that you enter the crumbling platform right before the blood on the floor starts burning, and then leave it before it falls down, all without stopping. In this case, you only have to worry about the Souls coming straight at you and you Evade or simply take a step to the side to dodge them. Be aware that the pull from the Ground Slam attack will happen while there's still some Souls out, so you need to make sure that there are no Souls between you and arena's center when it happens (or simply use Unstoppable ability to prevent the pull). The second stage of the fight is no different from the first one, but now Lilith has one more ability to choose from: Ground Slam. The next stage begins when Lilith HP falls below 60% mark. Lilith will once again open up with Flight (bottom left to top right) and then will start breaking off the corner of the platform. Unlike the first time, the safe zone of Flight doesn't perfectly overlap with the crumbling platform and there's some burning blood in the left corner of it. There's nothing different in the way you dodge this attack but it's a bit more difficult because the safe zone and the arena itself is now smaller. After the platform is broken, Lilith will teleport to the center and use Ground Slam. During this stage of the fight, Lilith doesn't gain any new abilities but she gets some upgrades: When Lilith falls below 30% HP, she will break the last corner of the platform, starting with Flight (bottom right to top left), then platform break with all the bells whistles and Souls. As she destroys the last platform, she will cast Shadow Clone. After this, the fight continues but Lilith now has no cooldown on her Flight ability and will often use it twice in a row in opposite directions, forcing you to run from one end of the arena to the other and stand in a tiny safe zone while dodging all the Souls coming for you. On top of that, the arena itself is so small now that you barely have space to dodge her Ground Slam and Shadow Clone attacks. Needless to say, staying alive and dealing damage is extremely difficult so it's recommended to Stagger Lilith either right before or right after the last transition and then deal as much damage as possible to shorten this stage of the fight or even outright kill her. The above description of the fight tells you what happens if you slowly and steadily deal damage to Lilith and she has plenty of time to perform all her special attacks. Things can be very different if your damage is overwhelmingly high and certain parts of the fight can be outright skipped. For example, if you deal 60% of Lilith's HP in one hit at the beginning of the fight, she will go up and then come down to summon Oppressors, and you will never have to fight any Enforcers. Now, most builds can't do that kind of damage but that's where Stagger comes in. Staggering Lilith lets you deal damage to her for 5 seconds uninterrupted and many builds can deal serious damage during that timeframe. If you Stagger her before she gets below 70% HP and then kill her before Stagger ends, you skip the most difficult parts of the first phase. If you manage to build stagger fast enough to Stagger her during the opening sequence of attacks, then you can finish the fight without dodging once. Depending on your damage output you can aim to stagger her at different HP thresholds: To manipulate the moment when Stagger happens you need to adjust the amount of stagger damage your build deals. There's two ways to do that: If you lack the damage to skip parts of the fight within one stagger, you can swap your gear during the fight. For example, you can use to build up Stagger and then switch to offensive gloves and during the Stagger. Reviewed by"

    "content": "As soon as you see Lilith crouch before her jump, start moving to the edge of the arena. If you get there fast enough, all the launching spots of the waves will be inside the circle. Then all you have to do is run to the opposite side until you get behind the 4th warning marker. This way you are never in a path of any waves and you are also right next to the Lilith's landing spot, ready to deal damage. If you fail to get to the edge of the arena in time, the safe areas may land outside the circle. In that case you have to dodge the attack the hard way. Move to the side of the first marker to let the wave pass you by. As soon as it passes, immediately get behind it to avoid the incoming side wave. Again, as soon as side wave passes, go behind it again to avoid the final wave coming down the middle. Keep in mind that the hitbox of the waves is slightly in front of them (which is further exacerbated by your latency), meaning that you will get hit before the wave even touches you. On the bright side, that also means that back side of the wave is quite safe: if you approach a wave from behind you can literally stand on top of the spikes without taking damage. Lilith leaps upward, briefly leaving the arena. After a 1.2 second delay, 3 warning markers are created on the ground: one directly next to the player and two more to the sides and far behind. One second later, Lilith's shadow clones come crashing down and launch 3 narrow waves of demonic spikes from the position of the markers. Finally Lilith herself comes down, launching the 4th wave down the middle lane from further back. This version is available when Lilith is below 70% HP. The exact same strategy can be used for this version: run to the edge, wait for marker, run to to opposite side to get behind the 4th wave. Since you always stay in the middle lane you don't have to worry about side waves no matter what direction they go. If you fail to get to the edge of the arena in time, you need to dodge differently. Get behind the first marker and then run behind the wave as closely as you can. When the side waves pass by, get out of the middle to avoid the incoming last wave. If the first marker is at the edge of the circle and you can't get behind it, simply run backwards and to the side to get behind one of the side waves. In this version, there are 3 waves going along the sides of a triangle in clockwise direction. Lilith herself comes down in the center of the triangle, dealing lethal damage in large circular AoE. This version is available when Lilith is below 40% HP. The general method of dodging remains the same: you need to get to one side of the circle so that the attack is aimed off-center, and then quickly dash to the safe area on the opposite site. Keep in mind that that the waves continue traveling past the vertices of the triangle so the to be safe you need to be completely outside it. Unlike the previous two versions, this attack leaves you with less time to react since you need to get out of the central AoE quickly. If you fail to get to the edge of the arena in time, there might be no safe zones at all and then only Invulnerability can save you. This version also has only 3 first waves from the second version. Instead of launching 4th wave down the middle, Lilith comes down directly next to the player, dealing lethal damage in large circular AoE. This version is available when Lilith is below 40% HP. The general method of dodging remains the same: you need to get to one side of the circle so that the attack is aimed off-center, and then quickly dash to the safe area on the opposite site. If you stay in the middle lane while doing that, don't forget about incoming wave that will come a few seconds later. Move left or right when the side waves pass you. If you fail to get to the edge of the arena in time, there might be no safe zones at all and then only Invulnerability can save you. Lilith plunges her tail into the ground while siphoning blood out of the player at the same time, dealing unavoidable damage and creating 8 Dancing Blood Orbs going around the player in two concentric circles. After a brief delay an explosion of blood goes off next to the player dealing damage and creating a new Blood Orb in the center. All previously created Blood Orbs caught in the explosion are destroyed. Dancing Blood Orbs deal minor damage and make the player Vulnerable for 2.5 seconds upon impact. After orbiting the player's original position for 5 seconds, Dancing Blood Orbs swiftly fly out of the arena. In this phase, Blood Orbs are not enemies but obstacles on the map. Stepping into a Blood Orb deals low damage over time to the player and slows them. During certain attacks in this phase, Blood Orbs create deadly Red Souls that chase down the player. If Lilith is Staggered, all Blood Orbs except two (selected at random) are destroyed. This attack applies a stacking debuff to the player, which increases its damage by 2% per stack. The initial hit and the blood explosion apply 2 stacks and each Dancing Blood Orb applies 1 stack on hit. The initial hit is unavoidable. Its damage grows over time, so you need to have enough DPS to end the fight before you accumulate too many stacks of the debuff. The explosion deals high damage but it's easy to dodge with Evade if you remember it's coming. This version of the attack does the same initial damage and creates Dancing Blood Orbs, but instead of creating a single blood explosion next to the player 4 explosions happen in different corners of the arena and 4 Blood Orbs are created. This version is used at the beginning of the second phase when there are no active Blood Orbs on the arena. It can be skipped completely if you manage to take Lilith below 85% health before she spawns them, making this entire phase significantly easier. Lilith strikes the player 1-3 times with her tail. Similar to first phase, the damage of this attack is so low that most builds can just facetank it and use it as an opportunity to deal damage. Lilith flies up into the air and pulls all enemies towards herself while slowing them for 3 seconds. At the same time, she summons 4-6 (depending on her HP) Children of Lilith. After a 2 second delay, Lilith slams down onto the ground, dealing lethal damage in a large circle. Children of Lilith are a ghoul type enemies who pose no threat on their own but can become a source of Souls during certain attacks. If you get hit by the pull + slow you won't be able to get out of the AoE by just running. You need to use an ability to prevent the pull or to remove the slow. Alternatively, you can use a mobility skill or 2-3 Evade charges to get out even while slowed. After dodging, kill the Children before continuing to fight Lilith. Lilith lets out a scream, knocking the player back. After that, Lilith dashes towards the player and shoots a three-pronged fork of shadows at the player, which deals heavy damage. Then she does this dash + fork combo a second time. At the same time, a shadow clone of Lilith is created nearby, which mimics her initial scream and two fork attacks with a 1 second delay.

Alternatively, you can use a mobility skill or 2-3 Evade charges to get out even while slowed. After dodging, kill the Children before continuing to fight Lilith. Lilith lets out a scream, knocking the player back. After that, Lilith dashes towards the player and shoots a three-pronged fork of shadows at the player, which deals heavy damage. Then she does this dash + fork combo a second time. At the same time, a shadow clone of Lilith is created nearby, which mimics her initial scream and two fork attacks with a 1 second delay. After all 4 forks are shot, Lilith slams the ground near player's position, releasing a massive shadow explosion that deals lethal damage. If Lilith is killed or Staggered during this attack, the shadow clone will continue acting on its own. Since Lilith's death animation is very long, you will receive no rewards for double KO. Very tanky builds can survive a single hit by a fork, but most have to dodge this attack entirely. To do that, move away from Lilith and run in a large circle. Each fork's middle prong is always aimed directly at you, so you will always dodge it as long as you move laterally. In doing so, you risk running into one of the side prongs, so you need to either be far enough away from Lilith or slow down a bit after you dodge the middle one. When Lilith raises her wings before the final part of the attack, move quickly to the opposite side of the arena to avoid the explosion. Lilith flies up and leaves the arena. After a brief delay, she comes back flying across the entire battlefield, covering the ground behind her in a thick layer of cursed blood. After a 3 second delay, the blood ignites, dealing lethal damage to all enemies caught in it for the next 2 seconds. There's always a safe zone at the side of the arena where Lilith finishes her flight. This attack is trivial to dodge on it's own and only becomes dangerous when combined with Souls chasing down the player. Remember that no damage is done until the blood catches fire, so you don't need to rush into the safe zone immediately. After player enters the arena, Lilith will drop down in the center, knocking the player back and creating a Circle of Doom that limits the size of the playable area. Stepping outside of the circle will deal extremely high damage over time to the player. The fight always starts with the fixed sequence of attacks: After that she will select one of 5 attacks available to her: Lilith will always prioritize Blood Orb Creation if it's not on cooldown. She will never do Melee Combo more than twice in a row. Otherwise the attacks are selected at random. During this stage of the fight, Lilith has long cooldowns on her high-damage attacks, giving you plenty of time to damage her and/or apply Stagger. Be ready to dodge Wave of Spikes or Death From Above when they come and you should be able to get through this stage without much trouble. When Lilith's health goes below 70%, she will finish her attack and summon 2 Enforcers. After that, she will continuously use Death From Above as long as at least one of the Enforcers is alive (but no less than 2 times). Each Enforcer will leave behind 2 Volatile Bloods and  6 Health Potion charges upon death. Enforcers themselves deal almost no damage. Your primary focus should be on dodging the Death From Above spam while killing them. Stay at the edge of the arena and let the Enforcers come to you. Be mindful of their pull attack as it can move you into the one-shot attacks from Lilith. If your build is not great at cleaning up Volatile Blood, try to kill the minions one-by-one and kill the Blood in-between. After you kill both minions, the camera returns to the normal zoom level and the second stage of the fight begins. Lilith's abilities are upgraded: Her attacks, in general, will follow this pattern: Your best strategy is to focus on dodging during steps 1-3 and doing damage during step 4. Since her Blood Orb Creation now has reduced cooldown and still has highest priority, the attack in step 2 will often be Blood Orb Creation. It's recommended to focus on dodging the incoming Death From Above first and killing Volatile Bloods second. Since Volatile Bloods take 12 seconds to detonate, you have plenty of time to kill it without the threat of a one-shot hanging over you. When Lilith's health goes below 40%, she will finish her attack and summon 3 Oppressors. Same as the first minion phase, she will spam use Death From Above as long as her minions live. This phase is not very different from the first one. Now there are 3 minions instead of 2 but they pose little threat and all the danger is coming from now further upgraded Death From Above. Our strategy stays the same: focus on dodging first and killing second. After the minions die, the fight continues with more improvements to Lilith's attacks: During this stage Lilith will simply use Death From Above after every 2-3 attacks giving you little time to deal damage. Stay at the edge of the arena at all times to make dodging easier and slowly work through her HP bar. When Lilith's HP hits 0, the circle created at the start of the fight will disappear and 20 seconds later Echo of Lilith, Mother of Mankind will spawn in the center. Lilith opens up the fight with a semi-fixed sequence of attacks: After that she behaves similar to her first phase. She casts Blood Orb Creation whenever its 15s cooldown is ready and otherwise randomly chooses between Melee Combo, Flight (~20s cooldown), and Shadow Clone (~20s cooldown). During this part of the fight, the only threatening attack Lilith has is Shadow Clone, but with plenty of space to dodge it, you can always run in a big circle and be completely fine. Instead, you should focus at dealing damage and managing Blood Orbs. When the Blood Orb Creation is coming up, move next to (or even inside of) one of the existing Blood Orbs to make sure that their numbers don't increase. Staggering Lilith at this stage is also beneficial as it will destroy some of the Blood Orbs. Alternatively, you can just run to the top of the arena to spawn new Blood Orbs, as this section of the arena will soon be destroyed. This, however, makes the next phase transition very hard to survive, so only do this if you have an Invulnerability skill to help you. After Lilith's HP falls below 85% she will finish her current attack and use Flight (bottom to top). After that, she performs a special move (Lilith can't be Staggered during this time) where she uses her wings to destroy part of the arena. This section overlaps with the safe zone of previously used Flight and players standing on it take minor damage over time. 6 seconds later, the cut-off section crumbles down into the abyss, instantly killing all players standing on it. While the platform is crumbling and for 2 second after, Blood Orbs shoot Souls at the player. 2 Souls are created each second, regardless of the number of currently active Blood Orbs. Souls move at ~133% Movement Speed and home in on their target, but their turn speed is very low, making it possible to sidestep them. Souls deal heavy damage on contact. After the platform is broken, Lilith teleports to the center of arena and uses Ground Slam. Dodging all these attacks can be tricky but it becomes much easier if you can outrun the Souls. Then you just have to run in a large circle, timing it in such a way that you enter the crumbling platform right before the blood on the floor starts burning, and then leave it before it falls down, all without stopping. In this case, you only have to worry about the Souls coming straight at you and you Evade or simply take a step to the side to dodge them. Be aware that the pull from the Ground Slam attack will happen while there's still some Souls out, so you need to make sure that there are no Souls between you and arena's center when it happens (or simply use Unstoppable ability to prevent the pull). The second stage of the fight is no different from the first one, but now Lilith has one more ability to choose from: Ground Slam. The next stage begins when Lilith HP falls below 60% mark. Lilith will once again open up with Flight (bottom left to top right) and then will start breaking off the corner of the platform. Unlike the first time, the safe zone of Flight doesn't perfectly overlap with the crumbling platform and there's some burning blood in the left corner of it. There's nothing different in the way you dodge this attack but it's a bit more difficult because the safe zone and the arena itself is now smaller. After the platform is broken, Lilith will teleport to the center and use Ground Slam. During this stage of the fight, Lilith doesn't gain any new abilities but she gets some upgrades: When Lilith falls below 30% HP, she will break the last corner of the platform, starting with Flight (bottom right to top left), then platform break with all the bells whistles and Souls. As she destroys the last platform, she will cast Shadow Clone. After this, the fight continues but Lilith now has no cooldown on her Flight ability and will often use it twice in a row in opposite directions, forcing you to run from one end of the arena to the other and stand in a tiny safe zone while dodging all the Souls coming for you. On top of that, the arena itself is so small now that you barely have space to dodge her Ground Slam and Shadow Clone attacks. Needless to say, staying alive and dealing damage is extremely difficult so it's recommended to Stagger Lilith either right before or right after the last transition and then deal as much damage as possible to shorten this stage of the fight or even outright kill her. The above description of the fight tells you what happens if you slowly and steadily deal damage to Lilith and she has plenty of time to perform all her special attacks. Things can be very different if your damage is overwhelmingly high and certain parts of the fight can be outright skipped. For example, if you deal 60% of Lilith's HP in one hit at the beginning of the fight, she will go up and then come down to summon Oppressors, and you will never have to fight any Enforcers. Now, most builds can't do that kind of damage but that's where Stagger comes in. Staggering Lilith lets you deal damage to her for 5 seconds uninterrupted and many builds can deal serious damage during that timeframe. If you Stagger her before she gets below 70% HP and then kill her before Stagger ends, you skip the most difficult parts of the first phase. If you manage to build stagger fast enough to Stagger her during the opening sequence of attacks, then you can finish the fight without dodging once. Depending on your damage output you can aim to stagger her at different HP thresholds: To manipulate the moment when Stagger happens you need to adjust the amount of stagger damage your build deals. There's two ways to do that: If you lack the damage to skip parts of the fight within one stagger, you can swap your gear during the fight. For example, you can use to build up Stagger and then switch to offensive gloves and during the Stagger. Reviewed by"

    "content": "Lilith leaps upward, briefly leaving the arena. After a 1.2 second delay, 3 warning markers are created on the ground: one directly next to the player and two more to the sides and far behind. One second later, Lilith's shadow clones come crashing down and launch 3 narrow waves of demonic spikes from the position of the markers. Finally Lilith herself comes down, launching the 4th wave down the middle lane from further back. This version is available when Lilith is below 70% HP. The exact same strategy can be used for this version: run to the edge, wait for marker, run to to opposite side to get behind the 4th wave. Since you always stay in the middle lane you don't have to worry about side waves no matter what direction they go. If you fail to get to the edge of the arena in time, you need to dodge differently. Get behind the first marker and then run behind the wave as closely as you can. When the side waves pass by, get out of the middle to avoid the incoming last wave. If the first marker is at the edge of the circle and you can't get behind it, simply run backwards and to the side to get behind one of the side waves. In this version, there are 3 waves going along the sides of a triangle in clockwise direction. Lilith herself comes down in the center of the triangle, dealing lethal damage in large circular AoE. This version is available when Lilith is below 40% HP. The general method of dodging remains the same: you need to get to one side of the circle so that the attack is aimed off-center, and then quickly dash to the safe area on the opposite site. Keep in mind that that the waves continue traveling past the vertices of the triangle so the to be safe you need to be completely outside it. Unlike the previous two versions, this attack leaves you with less time to react since you need to get out of the central AoE quickly. If you fail to get to the edge of the arena in time, there might be no safe zones at all and then only Invulnerability can save you. This version also has only 3 first waves from the second version. Instead of launching 4th wave down the middle, Lilith comes down directly next to the player, dealing lethal damage in large circular AoE. This version is available when Lilith is below 40% HP. The general method of dodging remains the same: you need to get to one side of the circle so that the attack is aimed off-center, and then quickly dash to the safe area on the opposite site. If you stay in the middle lane while doing that, don't forget about incoming wave that will come a few seconds later. Move left or right when the side waves pass you. If you fail to get to the edge of the arena in time, there might be no safe zones at all and then only Invulnerability can save you. Lilith plunges her tail into the ground while siphoning blood out of the player at the same time, dealing unavoidable damage and creating 8 Dancing Blood Orbs going around the player in two concentric circles. After a brief delay an explosion of blood goes off next to the player dealing damage and creating a new Blood Orb in the center. All previously created Blood Orbs caught in the explosion are destroyed. Dancing Blood Orbs deal minor damage and make the player Vulnerable for 2.5 seconds upon impact. After orbiting the player's original position for 5 seconds, Dancing Blood Orbs swiftly fly out of the arena. In this phase, Blood Orbs are not enemies but obstacles on the map. Stepping into a Blood Orb deals low damage over time to the player and slows them. During certain attacks in this phase, Blood Orbs create deadly Red Souls that chase down the player. If Lilith is Staggered, all Blood Orbs except two (selected at random) are destroyed. This attack applies a stacking debuff to the player, which increases its damage by 2% per stack. The initial hit and the blood explosion apply 2 stacks and each Dancing Blood Orb applies 1 stack on hit. The initial hit is unavoidable. Its damage grows over time, so you need to have enough DPS to end the fight before you accumulate too many stacks of the debuff. The explosion deals high damage but it's easy to dodge with Evade if you remember it's coming. This version of the attack does the same initial damage and creates Dancing Blood Orbs, but instead of creating a single blood explosion next to the player 4 explosions happen in different corners of the arena and 4 Blood Orbs are created. This version is used at the beginning of the second phase when there are no active Blood Orbs on the arena. It can be skipped completely if you manage to take Lilith below 85% health before she spawns them, making this entire phase significantly easier. Lilith strikes the player 1-3 times with her tail. Similar to first phase, the damage of this attack is so low that most builds can just facetank it and use it as an opportunity to deal damage. Lilith flies up into the air and pulls all enemies towards herself while slowing them for 3 seconds. At the same time, she summons 4-6 (depending on her HP) Children of Lilith. After a 2 second delay, Lilith slams down onto the ground, dealing lethal damage in a large circle. Children of Lilith are a ghoul type enemies who pose no threat on their own but can become a source of Souls during certain attacks. If you get hit by the pull + slow you won't be able to get out of the AoE by just running. You need to use an ability to prevent the pull or to remove the slow.

She will never do Melee Combo more than twice in a row. Otherwise the attacks are selected at random. During this stage of the fight, Lilith has long cooldowns on her high-damage attacks, giving you plenty of time to damage her and/or apply Stagger. Be ready to dodge Wave of Spikes or Death From Above when they come and you should be able to get through this stage without much trouble. When Lilith's health goes below 70%, she will finish her attack and summon 2 Enforcers. After that, she will continuously use Death From Above as long as at least one of the Enforcers is alive (but no less than 2 times). Each Enforcer will leave behind 2 Volatile Bloods and  6 Health Potion charges upon death. Enforcers themselves deal almost no damage. Your primary focus should be on dodging the Death From Above spam while killing them. Stay at the edge of the arena and let the Enforcers come to you. Be mindful of their pull attack as it can move you into the one-shot attacks from Lilith. If your build is not great at cleaning up Volatile Blood, try to kill the minions one-by-one and kill the Blood in-between. After you kill both minions, the camera returns to the normal zoom level and the second stage of the fight begins. Lilith's abilities are upgraded: Her attacks, in general, will follow this pattern: Your best strategy is to focus on dodging during steps 1-3 and doing damage during step 4. Since her Blood Orb Creation now has reduced cooldown and still has highest priority, the attack in step 2 will often be Blood Orb Creation. It's recommended to focus on dodging the incoming Death From Above first and killing Volatile Bloods second. Since Volatile Bloods take 12 seconds to detonate, you have plenty of time to kill it without the threat of a one-shot hanging over you. When Lilith's health goes below 40%, she will finish her attack and summon 3 Oppressors. Same as the first minion phase, she will spam use Death From Above as long as her minions live. This phase is not very different from the first one. Now there are 3 minions instead of 2 but they pose little threat and all the danger is coming from now further upgraded Death From Above. Our strategy stays the same: focus on dodging first and killing second. After the minions die, the fight continues with more improvements to Lilith's attacks: During this stage Lilith will simply use Death From Above after every 2-3 attacks giving you little time to deal damage. Stay at the edge of the arena at all times to make dodging easier and slowly work through her HP bar. When Lilith's HP hits 0, the circle created at the start of the fight will disappear and 20 seconds later Echo of Lilith, Mother of Mankind will spawn in the center. Lilith opens up the fight with a semi-fixed sequence of attacks: After that she behaves similar to her first phase. She casts Blood Orb Creation whenever its 15s cooldown is ready and otherwise randomly chooses between Melee Combo, Flight (~20s cooldown), and Shadow Clone (~20s cooldown). During this part of the fight, the only threatening attack Lilith has is Shadow Clone, but with plenty of space to dodge it, you can always run in a big circle and be completely fine. Instead, you should focus at dealing damage and managing Blood Orbs. When the Blood Orb Creation is coming up, move next to (or even inside of) one of the existing Blood Orbs to make sure that their numbers don't increase. Staggering Lilith at this stage is also beneficial as it will destroy some of the Blood Orbs. Alternatively, you can just run to the top of the arena to spawn new Blood Orbs, as this section of the arena will soon be destroyed. This, however, makes the next phase transition very hard to survive, so only do this if you have an Invulnerability skill to help you. After Lilith's HP falls below 85% she will finish her current attack and use Flight (bottom to top). After that, she performs a special move (Lilith can't be Staggered during this time) where she uses her wings to destroy part of the arena. This section overlaps with the safe zone of previously used Flight and players standing on it take minor damage over time. 6 seconds later, the cut-off section crumbles down into the abyss, instantly killing all players standing on it. While the platform is crumbling and for 2 second after, Blood Orbs shoot Souls at the player. 2 Souls are created each second, regardless of the number of currently active Blood Orbs. Souls move at ~133% Movement Speed and home in on their target, but their turn speed is very low, making it possible to sidestep them. Souls deal heavy damage on contact. After the platform is broken, Lilith teleports to the center of arena and uses Ground Slam. Dodging all these attacks can be tricky but it becomes much easier if you can outrun the Souls. Then you just have to run in a large circle, timing it in such a way that you enter the crumbling platform right before the blood on the floor starts burning, and then leave it before it falls down, all without stopping. In this case, you only have to worry about the Souls coming straight at you and you Evade or simply take a step to the side to dodge them. Be aware that the pull from the Ground Slam attack will happen while there's still some Souls out, so you need to make sure that there are no Souls between you and arena's center when it happens (or simply use Unstoppable ability to prevent the pull). The second stage of the fight is no different from the first one, but now Lilith has one more ability to choose from: Ground Slam. The next stage begins when Lilith HP falls below 60% mark. Lilith will once again open up with Flight (bottom left to top right) and then will start breaking off the corner of the platform. Unlike the first time, the safe zone of Flight doesn't perfectly overlap with the crumbling platform and there's some burning blood in the left corner of it. There's nothing different in the way you dodge this attack but it's a bit more difficult because the safe zone and the arena itself is now smaller. After the platform is broken, Lilith will teleport to the center and use Ground Slam. During this stage of the fight, Lilith doesn't gain any new abilities but she gets some upgrades: When Lilith falls below 30% HP, she will break the last corner of the platform, starting with Flight (bottom right to top left), then platform break with all the bells whistles and Souls. As she destroys the last platform, she will cast Shadow Clone. After this, the fight continues but Lilith now has no cooldown on her Flight ability and will often use it twice in a row in opposite directions, forcing you to run from one end of the arena to the other and stand in a tiny safe zone while dodging all the Souls coming for you. On top of that, the arena itself is so small now that you barely have space to dodge her Ground Slam and Shadow Clone attacks. Needless to say, staying alive and dealing damage is extremely difficult so it's recommended to Stagger Lilith either right before or right after the last transition and then deal as much damage as possible to shorten this stage of the fight or even outright kill her. The above description of the fight tells you what happens if you slowly and steadily deal damage to Lilith and she has plenty of time to perform all her special attacks. Things can be very different if your damage is overwhelmingly high and certain parts of the fight can be outright skipped. For example, if you deal 60% of Lilith's HP in one hit at the beginning of the fight, she will go up and then come down to summon Oppressors, and you will never have to fight any Enforcers. Now, most builds can't do that kind of damage but that's where Stagger comes in. Staggering Lilith lets you deal damage to her for 5 seconds uninterrupted and many builds can deal serious damage during that timeframe. If you Stagger her before she gets below 70% HP and then kill her before Stagger ends, you skip the most difficult parts of the first phase. If you manage to build stagger fast enough to Stagger her during the opening sequence of attacks, then you can finish the fight without dodging once. Depending on your damage output you can aim to stagger her at different HP thresholds: To manipulate the moment when Stagger happens you need to adjust the amount of stagger damage your build deals. There's two ways to do that: If you lack the damage to skip parts of the fight within one stagger, you can swap your gear during the fight. For example, you can use to build up Stagger and then switch to offensive gloves and during the Stagger. Reviewed by"

    "content": "The exact same strategy can be used for this version: run to the edge, wait for marker, run to to opposite side to get behind the 4th wave. Since you always stay in the middle lane you don't have to worry about side waves no matter what direction they go. If you fail to get to the edge of the arena in time, you need to dodge differently. Get behind the first marker and then run behind the wave as closely as you can. When the side waves pass by, get out of the middle to avoid the incoming last wave. If the first marker is at the edge of the circle and you can't get behind it, simply run backwards and to the side to get behind one of the side waves. In this version, there are 3 waves going along the sides of a triangle in clockwise direction. Lilith herself comes down in the center of the triangle, dealing lethal damage in large circular AoE. This version is available when Lilith is below 40% HP. The general method of dodging remains the same: you need to get to one side of the circle so that the attack is aimed off-center, and then quickly dash to the safe area on the opposite site. Keep in mind that that the waves continue traveling past the vertices of the triangle so the to be safe you need to be completely outside it. Unlike the previous two versions, this attack leaves you with less time to react since you need to get out of the central AoE quickly. If you fail to get to the edge of the arena in time, there might be no safe zones at all and then only Invulnerability can save you. This version also has only 3 first waves from the second version. Instead of launching 4th wave down the middle, Lilith comes down directly next to the player, dealing lethal damage in large circular AoE. This version is available when Lilith is below 40% HP. The general method of dodging remains the same: you need to get to one side of the circle so that the attack is aimed off-center, and then quickly dash to the safe area on the opposite site. If you stay in the middle lane while doing that, don't forget about incoming wave that will come a few seconds later. Move left or right when the side waves pass you. If you fail to get to the edge of the arena in time, there might be no safe zones at all and then only Invulnerability can save you. Lilith plunges her tail into the ground while siphoning blood out of the player at the same time, dealing unavoidable damage and creating 8 Dancing Blood Orbs going around the player in two concentric circles. After a brief delay an explosion of blood goes off next to the player dealing damage and creating a new Blood Orb in the center. All previously created Blood Orbs caught in the explosion are destroyed. Dancing Blood Orbs deal minor damage and make the player Vulnerable for 2.5 seconds upon impact. After orbiting the player's original position for 5 seconds, Dancing Blood Orbs swiftly fly out of the arena. In this phase, Blood Orbs are not enemies but obstacles on the map. Stepping into a Blood Orb deals low damage over time to the player and slows them. During certain attacks in this phase, Blood Orbs create deadly Red Souls that chase down the player. If Lilith is Staggered, all Blood Orbs except two (selected at random) are destroyed. This attack applies a stacking debuff to the player, which increases its damage by 2% per stack. The initial hit and the blood explosion apply 2 stacks and each Dancing Blood Orb applies 1 stack on hit. The initial hit is unavoidable. Its damage grows over time, so you need to have enough DPS to end the fight before you accumulate too many stacks of the debuff. The explosion deals high damage but it's easy to dodge with Evade if you remember it's coming. This version of the attack does the same initial damage and creates Dancing Blood Orbs, but instead of creating a single blood explosion next to the player 4 explosions happen in different corners of the arena and 4 Blood Orbs are created. This version is used at the beginning of the second phase when there are no active Blood Orbs on the arena. It can be skipped completely if you manage to take Lilith below 85% health before she spawns them, making this entire phase significantly easier. Lilith strikes the player 1-3 times with her tail. Similar to first phase, the damage of this attack is so low that most builds can just facetank it and use it as an opportunity to deal damage. Lilith flies up into the air and pulls all enemies towards herself while slowing them for 3 seconds. At the same time, she summons 4-6 (depending on her HP) Children of Lilith. After a 2 second delay, Lilith slams down onto the ground, dealing lethal damage in a large circle. Children of Lilith are a ghoul type enemies who pose no threat on their own but can become a source of Souls during certain attacks. If you get hit by the pull + slow you won't be able to get out of the AoE by just running. You need to use an ability to prevent the pull or to remove the slow. Alternatively, you can use a mobility skill or 2-3 Evade charges to get out even while slowed. After dodging, kill the Children before continuing to fight Lilith. Lilith lets out a scream, knocking the player back. After that, Lilith dashes towards the player and shoots a three-pronged fork of shadows at the player, which deals heavy damage. Then she does this dash + fork combo a second time. At the same time, a shadow clone of Lilith is created nearby, which mimics her initial scream and two fork attacks with a 1 second delay. After all 4 forks are shot, Lilith slams the ground near player's position, releasing a massive shadow explosion that deals lethal damage. If Lilith is killed or Staggered during this attack, the shadow clone will continue acting on its own. Since Lilith's death animation is very long, you will receive no rewards for double KO. Very tanky builds can survive a single hit by a fork, but most have to dodge this attack entirely. To do that, move away from Lilith and run in a large circle. Each fork's middle prong is always aimed directly at you, so you will always dodge it as long as you move laterally. In doing so, you risk running into one of the side prongs, so you need to either be far enough away from Lilith or slow down a bit after you dodge the middle one. When Lilith raises her wings before the final part of the attack, move quickly to the opposite side of the arena to avoid the explosion. Lilith flies up and leaves the arena. After a brief delay, she comes back flying across the entire battlefield, covering the ground behind her in a thick layer of cursed blood. After a 3 second delay, the blood ignites, dealing lethal damage to all enemies caught in it for the next 2 seconds. There's always a safe zone at the side of the arena where Lilith finishes her flight. This attack is trivial to dodge on it's own and only becomes dangerous when combined with Souls chasing down the player. Remember that no damage is done until the blood catches fire, so you don't need to rush into the safe zone immediately. After player enters the arena, Lilith will drop down in the center, knocking the player back and creating a Circle of Doom that limits the size of the playable area. Stepping outside of the circle will deal extremely high damage over time to the player. The fight always starts with the fixed sequence of attacks: After that she will select one of 5 attacks available to her: Lilith will always prioritize Blood Orb Creation if it's not on cooldown. She will never do Melee Combo more than twice in a row. Otherwise the attacks are selected at random.

During this part of the fight, the only threatening attack Lilith has is Shadow Clone, but with plenty of space to dodge it, you can always run in a big circle and be completely fine. Instead, you should focus at dealing damage and managing Blood Orbs. When the Blood Orb Creation is coming up, move next to (or even inside of) one of the existing Blood Orbs to make sure that their numbers don't increase. Staggering Lilith at this stage is also beneficial as it will destroy some of the Blood Orbs. Alternatively, you can just run to the top of the arena to spawn new Blood Orbs, as this section of the arena will soon be destroyed. This, however, makes the next phase transition very hard to survive, so only do this if you have an Invulnerability skill to help you. After Lilith's HP falls below 85% she will finish her current attack and use Flight (bottom to top). After that, she performs a special move (Lilith can't be Staggered during this time) where she uses her wings to destroy part of the arena. This section overlaps with the safe zone of previously used Flight and players standing on it take minor damage over time. 6 seconds later, the cut-off section crumbles down into the abyss, instantly killing all players standing on it. While the platform is crumbling and for 2 second after, Blood Orbs shoot Souls at the player. 2 Souls are created each second, regardless of the number of currently active Blood Orbs. Souls move at ~133% Movement Speed and home in on their target, but their turn speed is very low, making it possible to sidestep them. Souls deal heavy damage on contact. After the platform is broken, Lilith teleports to the center of arena and uses Ground Slam. Dodging all these attacks can be tricky but it becomes much easier if you can outrun the Souls. Then you just have to run in a large circle, timing it in such a way that you enter the crumbling platform right before the blood on the floor starts burning, and then leave it before it falls down, all without stopping. In this case, you only have to worry about the Souls coming straight at you and you Evade or simply take a step to the side to dodge them. Be aware that the pull from the Ground Slam attack will happen while there's still some Souls out, so you need to make sure that there are no Souls between you and arena's center when it happens (or simply use Unstoppable ability to prevent the pull). The second stage of the fight is no different from the first one, but now Lilith has one more ability to choose from: Ground Slam. The next stage begins when Lilith HP falls below 60% mark. Lilith will once again open up with Flight (bottom left to top right) and then will start breaking off the corner of the platform. Unlike the first time, the safe zone of Flight doesn't perfectly overlap with the crumbling platform and there's some burning blood in the left corner of it. There's nothing different in the way you dodge this attack but it's a bit more difficult because the safe zone and the arena itself is now smaller. After the platform is broken, Lilith will teleport to the center and use Ground Slam. During this stage of the fight, Lilith doesn't gain any new abilities but she gets some upgrades: When Lilith falls below 30% HP, she will break the last corner of the platform, starting with Flight (bottom right to top left), then platform break with all the bells whistles and Souls. As she destroys the last platform, she will cast Shadow Clone. After this, the fight continues but Lilith now has no cooldown on her Flight ability and will often use it twice in a row in opposite directions, forcing you to run from one end of the arena to the other and stand in a tiny safe zone while dodging all the Souls coming for you. On top of that, the arena itself is so small now that you barely have space to dodge her Ground Slam and Shadow Clone attacks. Needless to say, staying alive and dealing damage is extremely difficult so it's recommended to Stagger Lilith either right before or right after the last transition and then deal as much damage as possible to shorten this stage of the fight or even outright kill her. The above description of the fight tells you what happens if you slowly and steadily deal damage to Lilith and she has plenty of time to perform all her special attacks. Things can be very different if your damage is overwhelmingly high and certain parts of the fight can be outright skipped. For example, if you deal 60% of Lilith's HP in one hit at the beginning of the fight, she will go up and then come down to summon Oppressors, and you will never have to fight any Enforcers. Now, most builds can't do that kind of damage but that's where Stagger comes in. Staggering Lilith lets you deal damage to her for 5 seconds uninterrupted and many builds can deal serious damage during that timeframe. If you Stagger her before she gets below 70% HP and then kill her before Stagger ends, you skip the most difficult parts of the first phase. If you manage to build stagger fast enough to Stagger her during the opening sequence of attacks, then you can finish the fight without dodging once. Depending on your damage output you can aim to stagger her at different HP thresholds: To manipulate the moment when Stagger happens you need to adjust the amount of stagger damage your build deals. There's two ways to do that: If you lack the damage to skip parts of the fight within one stagger, you can swap your gear during the fight. For example, you can use to build up Stagger and then switch to offensive gloves and during the Stagger. Reviewed by"

    "content": "In this version, there are 3 waves going along the sides of a triangle in clockwise direction. Lilith herself comes down in the center of the triangle, dealing lethal damage in large circular AoE. This version is available when Lilith is below 40% HP. The general method of dodging remains the same: you need to get to one side of the circle so that the attack is aimed off-center, and then quickly dash to the safe area on the opposite site. Keep in mind that that the waves continue traveling past the vertices of the triangle so the to be safe you need to be completely outside it. Unlike the previous two versions, this attack leaves you with less time to react since you need to get out of the central AoE quickly. If you fail to get to the edge of the arena in time, there might be no safe zones at all and then only Invulnerability can save you. This version also has only 3 first waves from the second version. Instead of launching 4th wave down the middle, Lilith comes down directly next to the player, dealing lethal damage in large circular AoE. This version is available when Lilith is below 40% HP. The general method of dodging remains the same: you need to get to one side of the circle so that the attack is aimed off-center, and then quickly dash to the safe area on the opposite site. If you stay in the middle lane while doing that, don't forget about incoming wave that will come a few seconds later. Move left or right when the side waves pass you. If you fail to get to the edge of the arena in time, there might be no safe zones at all and then only Invulnerability can save you. Lilith plunges her tail into the ground while siphoning blood out of the player at the same time, dealing unavoidable damage and creating 8 Dancing Blood Orbs going around the player in two concentric circles. After a brief delay an explosion of blood goes off next to the player dealing damage and creating a new Blood Orb in the center. All previously created Blood Orbs caught in the explosion are destroyed. Dancing Blood Orbs deal minor damage and make the player Vulnerable for 2.5 seconds upon impact. After orbiting the player's original position for 5 seconds, Dancing Blood Orbs swiftly fly out of the arena. In this phase, Blood Orbs are not enemies but obstacles on the map. Stepping into a Blood Orb deals low damage over time to the player and slows them. During certain attacks in this phase, Blood Orbs create deadly Red Souls that chase down the player. If Lilith is Staggered, all Blood Orbs except two (selected at random) are destroyed. This attack applies a stacking debuff to the player, which increases its damage by 2% per stack. The initial hit and the blood explosion apply 2 stacks and each Dancing Blood Orb applies 1 stack on hit. The initial hit is unavoidable. Its damage grows over time, so you need to have enough DPS to end the fight before you accumulate too many stacks of the debuff. The explosion deals high damage but it's easy to dodge with Evade if you remember it's coming. This version of the attack does the same initial damage and creates Dancing Blood Orbs, but instead of creating a single blood explosion next to the player 4 explosions happen in different corners of the arena and 4 Blood Orbs are created. This version is used at the beginning of the second phase when there are no active Blood Orbs on the arena. It can be skipped completely if you manage to take Lilith below 85% health before she spawns them, making this entire phase significantly easier. Lilith strikes the player 1-3 times with her tail. Similar to first phase, the damage of this attack is so low that most builds can just facetank it and use it as an opportunity to deal damage. Lilith flies up into the air and pulls all enemies towards herself while slowing them for 3 seconds. At the same time, she summons 4-6 (depending on her HP) Children of Lilith. After a 2 second delay, Lilith slams down onto the ground, dealing lethal damage in a large circle. Children of Lilith are a ghoul type enemies who pose no threat on their own but can become a source of Souls during certain attacks. If you get hit by the pull + slow you won't be able to get out of the AoE by just running. You need to use an ability to prevent the pull or to remove the slow. Alternatively, you can use a mobility skill or 2-3 Evade charges to get out even while slowed. After dodging, kill the Children before continuing to fight Lilith. Lilith lets out a scream, knocking the player back. After that, Lilith dashes towards the player and shoots a three-pronged fork of shadows at the player, which deals heavy damage. Then she does this dash + fork combo a second time. At the same time, a shadow clone of Lilith is created nearby, which mimics her initial scream and two fork attacks with a 1 second delay. After all 4 forks are shot, Lilith slams the ground near player's position, releasing a massive shadow explosion that deals lethal damage. If Lilith is killed or Staggered during this attack, the shadow clone will continue acting on its own. Since Lilith's death animation is very long, you will receive no rewards for double KO. Very tanky builds can survive a single hit by a fork, but most have to dodge this attack entirely. To do that, move away from Lilith and run in a large circle. Each fork's middle prong is always aimed directly at you, so you will always dodge it as long as you move laterally. In doing so, you risk running into one of the side prongs, so you need to either be far enough away from Lilith or slow down a bit after you dodge the middle one. When Lilith raises her wings before the final part of the attack, move quickly to the opposite side of the arena to avoid the explosion. Lilith flies up and leaves the arena. After a brief delay, she comes back flying across the entire battlefield, covering the ground behind her in a thick layer of cursed blood. After a 3 second delay, the blood ignites, dealing lethal damage to all enemies caught in it for the next 2 seconds. There's always a safe zone at the side of the arena where Lilith finishes her flight. This attack is trivial to dodge on it's own and only becomes dangerous when combined with Souls chasing down the player. Remember that no damage is done until the blood catches fire, so you don't need to rush into the safe zone immediately. After player enters the arena, Lilith will drop down in the center, knocking the player back and creating a Circle of Doom that limits the size of the playable area. Stepping outside of the circle will deal extremely high damage over time to the player. The fight always starts with the fixed sequence of attacks: After that she will select one of 5 attacks available to her: Lilith will always prioritize Blood Orb Creation if it's not on cooldown. She will never do Melee Combo more than twice in a row. Otherwise the attacks are selected at random. During this stage of the fight, Lilith has long cooldowns on her high-damage attacks, giving you plenty of time to damage her and/or apply Stagger. Be ready to dodge Wave of Spikes or Death From Above when they come and you should be able to get through this stage without much trouble. When Lilith's health goes below 70%, she will finish her attack and summon 2 Enforcers. After that, she will continuously use Death From Above as long as at least one of the Enforcers is alive (but no less than 2 times). Each Enforcer will leave behind 2 Volatile Bloods and  6 Health Potion charges upon death. Enforcers themselves deal almost no damage. Your primary focus should be on dodging the Death From Above spam while killing them. Stay at the edge of the arena and let the Enforcers come to you. Be mindful of their pull attack as it can move you into the one-shot attacks from Lilith. If your build is not great at cleaning up Volatile Blood, try to kill the minions one-by-one and kill the Blood in-between. After you kill both minions, the camera returns to the normal zoom level and the second stage of the fight begins. Lilith's abilities are upgraded: Her attacks, in general, will follow this pattern: Your best strategy is to focus on dodging during steps 1-3 and doing damage during step 4. Since her Blood Orb Creation now has reduced cooldown and still has highest priority, the attack in step 2 will often be Blood Orb Creation. It's recommended to focus on dodging the incoming Death From Above first and killing Volatile Bloods second. Since Volatile Bloods take 12 seconds to detonate, you have plenty of time to kill it without the threat of a one-shot hanging over you. When Lilith's health goes below 40%, she will finish her attack and summon 3 Oppressors. Same as the first minion phase, she will spam use Death From Above as long as her minions live. This phase is not very different from the first one. Now there are 3 minions instead of 2 but they pose little threat and all the danger is coming from now further upgraded Death From Above. Our strategy stays the same: focus on dodging first and killing second. After the minions die, the fight continues with more improvements to Lilith's attacks: During this stage Lilith will simply use Death From Above after every 2-3 attacks giving you little time to deal damage. Stay at the edge of the arena at all times to make dodging easier and slowly work through her HP bar. When Lilith's HP hits 0, the circle created at the start of the fight will disappear and 20 seconds later Echo of Lilith, Mother of Mankind will spawn in the center. Lilith opens up the fight with a semi-fixed sequence of attacks: After that she behaves similar to her first phase. She casts Blood Orb Creation whenever its 15s cooldown is ready and otherwise randomly chooses between Melee Combo, Flight (~20s cooldown), and Shadow Clone (~20s cooldown). During this part of the fight, the only threatening attack Lilith has is Shadow Clone, but with plenty of space to dodge it, you can always run in a big circle and be completely fine. Instead, you should focus at dealing damage and managing Blood Orbs. When the Blood Orb Creation is coming up, move next to (or even inside of) one of the existing Blood Orbs to make sure that their numbers don't increase.

Needless to say, staying alive and dealing damage is extremely difficult so it's recommended to Stagger Lilith either right before or right after the last transition and then deal as much damage as possible to shorten this stage of the fight or even outright kill her. The above description of the fight tells you what happens if you slowly and steadily deal damage to Lilith and she has plenty of time to perform all her special attacks. Things can be very different if your damage is overwhelmingly high and certain parts of the fight can be outright skipped. For example, if you deal 60% of Lilith's HP in one hit at the beginning of the fight, she will go up and then come down to summon Oppressors, and you will never have to fight any Enforcers. Now, most builds can't do that kind of damage but that's where Stagger comes in. Staggering Lilith lets you deal damage to her for 5 seconds uninterrupted and many builds can deal serious damage during that timeframe. If you Stagger her before she gets below 70% HP and then kill her before Stagger ends, you skip the most difficult parts of the first phase. If you manage to build stagger fast enough to Stagger her during the opening sequence of attacks, then you can finish the fight without dodging once. Depending on your damage output you can aim to stagger her at different HP thresholds: To manipulate the moment when Stagger happens you need to adjust the amount of stagger damage your build deals. There's two ways to do that: If you lack the damage to skip parts of the fight within one stagger, you can swap your gear during the fight. For example, you can use to build up Stagger and then switch to offensive gloves and during the Stagger. Reviewed by"

    "content": "The general method of dodging remains the same: you need to get to one side of the circle so that the attack is aimed off-center, and then quickly dash to the safe area on the opposite site. Keep in mind that that the waves continue traveling past the vertices of the triangle so the to be safe you need to be completely outside it. Unlike the previous two versions, this attack leaves you with less time to react since you need to get out of the central AoE quickly. If you fail to get to the edge of the arena in time, there might be no safe zones at all and then only Invulnerability can save you. This version also has only 3 first waves from the second version. Instead of launching 4th wave down the middle, Lilith comes down directly next to the player, dealing lethal damage in large circular AoE. This version is available when Lilith is below 40% HP. The general method of dodging remains the same: you need to get to one side of the circle so that the attack is aimed off-center, and then quickly dash to the safe area on the opposite site. If you stay in the middle lane while doing that, don't forget about incoming wave that will come a few seconds later. Move left or right when the side waves pass you. If you fail to get to the edge of the arena in time, there might be no safe zones at all and then only Invulnerability can save you. Lilith plunges her tail into the ground while siphoning blood out of the player at the same time, dealing unavoidable damage and creating 8 Dancing Blood Orbs going around the player in two concentric circles. After a brief delay an explosion of blood goes off next to the player dealing damage and creating a new Blood Orb in the center. All previously created Blood Orbs caught in the explosion are destroyed. Dancing Blood Orbs deal minor damage and make the player Vulnerable for 2.5 seconds upon impact. After orbiting the player's original position for 5 seconds, Dancing Blood Orbs swiftly fly out of the arena. In this phase, Blood Orbs are not enemies but obstacles on the map. Stepping into a Blood Orb deals low damage over time to the player and slows them. During certain attacks in this phase, Blood Orbs create deadly Red Souls that chase down the player. If Lilith is Staggered, all Blood Orbs except two (selected at random) are destroyed. This attack applies a stacking debuff to the player, which increases its damage by 2% per stack. The initial hit and the blood explosion apply 2 stacks and each Dancing Blood Orb applies 1 stack on hit. The initial hit is unavoidable. Its damage grows over time, so you need to have enough DPS to end the fight before you accumulate too many stacks of the debuff. The explosion deals high damage but it's easy to dodge with Evade if you remember it's coming. This version of the attack does the same initial damage and creates Dancing Blood Orbs, but instead of creating a single blood explosion next to the player 4 explosions happen in different corners of the arena and 4 Blood Orbs are created. This version is used at the beginning of the second phase when there are no active Blood Orbs on the arena. It can be skipped completely if you manage to take Lilith below 85% health before she spawns them, making this entire phase significantly easier. Lilith strikes the player 1-3 times with her tail. Similar to first phase, the damage of this attack is so low that most builds can just facetank it and use it as an opportunity to deal damage. Lilith flies up into the air and pulls all enemies towards herself while slowing them for 3 seconds. At the same time, she summons 4-6 (depending on her HP) Children of Lilith. After a 2 second delay, Lilith slams down onto the ground, dealing lethal damage in a large circle. Children of Lilith are a ghoul type enemies who pose no threat on their own but can become a source of Souls during certain attacks. If you get hit by the pull + slow you won't be able to get out of the AoE by just running. You need to use an ability to prevent the pull or to remove the slow. Alternatively, you can use a mobility skill or 2-3 Evade charges to get out even while slowed. After dodging, kill the Children before continuing to fight Lilith. Lilith lets out a scream, knocking the player back. After that, Lilith dashes towards the player and shoots a three-pronged fork of shadows at the player, which deals heavy damage. Then she does this dash + fork combo a second time. At the same time, a shadow clone of Lilith is created nearby, which mimics her initial scream and two fork attacks with a 1 second delay. After all 4 forks are shot, Lilith slams the ground near player's position, releasing a massive shadow explosion that deals lethal damage. If Lilith is killed or Staggered during this attack, the shadow clone will continue acting on its own. Since Lilith's death animation is very long, you will receive no rewards for double KO. Very tanky builds can survive a single hit by a fork, but most have to dodge this attack entirely. To do that, move away from Lilith and run in a large circle. Each fork's middle prong is always aimed directly at you, so you will always dodge it as long as you move laterally. In doing so, you risk running into one of the side prongs, so you need to either be far enough away from Lilith or slow down a bit after you dodge the middle one. When Lilith raises her wings before the final part of the attack, move quickly to the opposite side of the arena to avoid the explosion. Lilith flies up and leaves the arena. After a brief delay, she comes back flying across the entire battlefield, covering the ground behind her in a thick layer of cursed blood. After a 3 second delay, the blood ignites, dealing lethal damage to all enemies caught in it for the next 2 seconds. There's always a safe zone at the side of the arena where Lilith finishes her flight. This attack is trivial to dodge on it's own and only becomes dangerous when combined with Souls chasing down the player. Remember that no damage is done until the blood catches fire, so you don't need to rush into the safe zone immediately. After player enters the arena, Lilith will drop down in the center, knocking the player back and creating a Circle of Doom that limits the size of the playable area. Stepping outside of the circle will deal extremely high damage over time to the player. The fight always starts with the fixed sequence of attacks: After that she will select one of 5 attacks available to her: Lilith will always prioritize Blood Orb Creation if it's not on cooldown. She will never do Melee Combo more than twice in a row. Otherwise the attacks are selected at random. During this stage of the fight, Lilith has long cooldowns on her high-damage attacks, giving you plenty of time to damage her and/or apply Stagger. Be ready to dodge Wave of Spikes or Death From Above when they come and you should be able to get through this stage without much trouble. When Lilith's health goes below 70%, she will finish her attack and summon 2 Enforcers. After that, she will continuously use Death From Above as long as at least one of the Enforcers is alive (but no less than 2 times). Each Enforcer will leave behind 2 Volatile Bloods and  6 Health Potion charges upon death. Enforcers themselves deal almost no damage. Your primary focus should be on dodging the Death From Above spam while killing them. Stay at the edge of the arena and let the Enforcers come to you. Be mindful of their pull attack as it can move you into the one-shot attacks from Lilith. If your build is not great at cleaning up Volatile Blood, try to kill the minions one-by-one and kill the Blood in-between. After you kill both minions, the camera returns to the normal zoom level and the second stage of the fight begins. Lilith's abilities are upgraded: Her attacks, in general, will follow this pattern: Your best strategy is to focus on dodging during steps 1-3 and doing damage during step 4. Since her Blood Orb Creation now has reduced cooldown and still has highest priority, the attack in step 2 will often be Blood Orb Creation. It's recommended to focus on dodging the incoming Death From Above first and killing Volatile Bloods second. Since Volatile Bloods take 12 seconds to detonate, you have plenty of time to kill it without the threat of a one-shot hanging over you. When Lilith's health goes below 40%, she will finish her attack and summon 3 Oppressors. Same as the first minion phase, she will spam use Death From Above as long as her minions live. This phase is not very different from the first one. Now there are 3 minions instead of 2 but they pose little threat and all the danger is coming from now further upgraded Death From Above. Our strategy stays the same: focus on dodging first and killing second. After the minions die, the fight continues with more improvements to Lilith's attacks: During this stage Lilith will simply use Death From Above after every 2-3 attacks giving you little time to deal damage. Stay at the edge of the arena at all times to make dodging easier and slowly work through her HP bar. When Lilith's HP hits 0, the circle created at the start of the fight will disappear and 20 seconds later Echo of Lilith, Mother of Mankind will spawn in the center. Lilith opens up the fight with a semi-fixed sequence of attacks: After that she behaves similar to her first phase. She casts Blood Orb Creation whenever its 15s cooldown is ready and otherwise randomly chooses between Melee Combo, Flight (~20s cooldown), and Shadow Clone (~20s cooldown). During this part of the fight, the only threatening attack Lilith has is Shadow Clone, but with plenty of space to dodge it, you can always run in a big circle and be completely fine. Instead, you should focus at dealing damage and managing Blood Orbs. When the Blood Orb Creation is coming up, move next to (or even inside of) one of the existing Blood Orbs to make sure that their numbers don't increase. Staggering Lilith at this stage is also beneficial as it will destroy some of the Blood Orbs. Alternatively, you can just run to the top of the arena to spawn new Blood Orbs, as this section of the arena will soon be destroyed. This, however, makes the next phase transition very hard to survive, so only do this if you have an Invulnerability skill to help you. After Lilith's HP falls below 85% she will finish her current attack and use Flight (bottom to top). After that, she performs a special move (Lilith can't be Staggered during this time) where she uses her wings to destroy part of the arena. This section overlaps with the safe zone of previously used Flight and players standing on it take minor damage over time. 6 seconds later, the cut-off section crumbles down into the abyss, instantly killing all players standing on it. While the platform is crumbling and for 2 second after, Blood Orbs shoot Souls at the player. 2 Souls are created each second, regardless of the number of currently active Blood Orbs. Souls move at ~133% Movement Speed and home in on their target, but their turn speed is very low, making it possible to sidestep them. Souls deal heavy damage on contact. After the platform is broken, Lilith teleports to the center of arena and uses Ground Slam. Dodging all these attacks can be tricky but it becomes much easier if you can outrun the Souls. Then you just have to run in a large circle, timing it in such a way that you enter the crumbling platform right before the blood on the floor starts burning, and then leave it before it falls down, all without stopping. In this case, you only have to worry about the Souls coming straight at you and you Evade or simply take a step to the side to dodge them. Be aware that the pull from the Ground Slam attack will happen while there's still some Souls out, so you need to make sure that there are no Souls between you and arena's center when it happens (or simply use Unstoppable ability to prevent the pull). The second stage of the fight is no different from the first one, but now Lilith has one more ability to choose from: Ground Slam. The next stage begins when Lilith HP falls below 60% mark. Lilith will once again open up with Flight (bottom left to top right) and then will start breaking off the corner of the platform. Unlike the first time, the safe zone of Flight doesn't perfectly overlap with the crumbling platform and there's some burning blood in the left corner of it. There's nothing different in the way you dodge this attack but it's a bit more difficult because the safe zone and the arena itself is now smaller. After the platform is broken, Lilith will teleport to the center and use Ground Slam. During this stage of the fight, Lilith doesn't gain any new abilities but she gets some upgrades: When Lilith falls below 30% HP, she will break the last corner of the platform, starting with Flight (bottom right to top left), then platform break with all the bells whistles and Souls. As she destroys the last platform, she will cast Shadow Clone. After this, the fight continues but Lilith now has no cooldown on her Flight ability and will often use it twice in a row in opposite directions, forcing you to run from one end of the arena to the other and stand in a tiny safe zone while dodging all the Souls coming for you. On top of that, the arena itself is so small now that you barely have space to dodge her Ground Slam and Shadow Clone attacks. Needless to say, staying alive and dealing damage is extremely difficult so it's recommended to Stagger Lilith either right before or right after the last transition and then deal as much damage as possible to shorten this stage of the fight or even outright kill her. The above description of the fight tells you what happens if you slowly and steadily deal damage to Lilith and she has plenty of time to perform all her special attacks. Things can be very different if your damage is overwhelmingly high and certain parts of the fight can be outright skipped. For example, if you deal 60% of Lilith's HP in one hit at the beginning of the fight, she will go up and then come down to summon Oppressors, and you will never have to fight any Enforcers. Now, most builds can't do that kind of damage but that's where Stagger comes in. Staggering Lilith lets you deal damage to her for 5 seconds uninterrupted and many builds can deal serious damage during that timeframe. If you Stagger her before she gets below 70% HP and then kill her before Stagger ends, you skip the most difficult parts of the first phase. If you manage to build stagger fast enough to Stagger her during the opening sequence of attacks, then you can finish the fight without dodging once. Depending on your damage output you can aim to stagger her at different HP thresholds: To manipulate the moment when Stagger happens you need to adjust the amount of stagger damage your build deals. There's two ways to do that: If you lack the damage to skip parts of the fight within one stagger, you can swap your gear during the fight. For example, you can use to build up Stagger and then switch to offensive gloves and during the Stagger. Reviewed by"

When Lilith raises her wings before the final part of the attack, move quickly to the opposite side of the arena to avoid the explosion. Lilith flies up and leaves the arena. After a brief delay, she comes back flying across the entire battlefield, covering the ground behind her in a thick layer of cursed blood. After a 3 second delay, the blood ignites, dealing lethal damage to all enemies caught in it for the next 2 seconds. There's always a safe zone at the side of the arena where Lilith finishes her flight. This attack is trivial to dodge on it's own and only becomes dangerous when combined with Souls chasing down the player. Remember that no damage is done until the blood catches fire, so you don't need to rush into the safe zone immediately. After player enters the arena, Lilith will drop down in the center, knocking the player back and creating a Circle of Doom that limits the size of the playable area. Stepping outside of the circle will deal extremely high damage over time to the player. The fight always starts with the fixed sequence of attacks: After that she will select one of 5 attacks available to her: Lilith will always prioritize Blood Orb Creation if it's not on cooldown. She will never do Melee Combo more than twice in a row. Otherwise the attacks are selected at random. During this stage of the fight, Lilith has long cooldowns on her high-damage attacks, giving you plenty of time to damage her and/or apply Stagger. Be ready to dodge Wave of Spikes or Death From Above when they come and you should be able to get through this stage without much trouble. When Lilith's health goes below 70%, she will finish her attack and summon 2 Enforcers. After that, she will continuously use Death From Above as long as at least one of the Enforcers is alive (but no less than 2 times). Each Enforcer will leave behind 2 Volatile Bloods and  6 Health Potion charges upon death. Enforcers themselves deal almost no damage. Your primary focus should be on dodging the Death From Above spam while killing them. Stay at the edge of the arena and let the Enforcers come to you. Be mindful of their pull attack as it can move you into the one-shot attacks from Lilith. If your build is not great at cleaning up Volatile Blood, try to kill the minions one-by-one and kill the Blood in-between. After you kill both minions, the camera returns to the normal zoom level and the second stage of the fight begins. Lilith's abilities are upgraded: Her attacks, in general, will follow this pattern: Your best strategy is to focus on dodging during steps 1-3 and doing damage during step 4. Since her Blood Orb Creation now has reduced cooldown and still has highest priority, the attack in step 2 will often be Blood Orb Creation. It's recommended to focus on dodging the incoming Death From Above first and killing Volatile Bloods second. Since Volatile Bloods take 12 seconds to detonate, you have plenty of time to kill it without the threat of a one-shot hanging over you. When Lilith's health goes below 40%, she will finish her attack and summon 3 Oppressors. Same as the first minion phase, she will spam use Death From Above as long as her minions live. This phase is not very different from the first one. Now there are 3 minions instead of 2 but they pose little threat and all the danger is coming from now further upgraded Death From Above. Our strategy stays the same: focus on dodging first and killing second. After the minions die, the fight continues with more improvements to Lilith's attacks: During this stage Lilith will simply use Death From Above after every 2-3 attacks giving you little time to deal damage. Stay at the edge of the arena at all times to make dodging easier and slowly work through her HP bar. When Lilith's HP hits 0, the circle created at the start of the fight will disappear and 20 seconds later Echo of Lilith, Mother of Mankind will spawn in the center. Lilith opens up the fight with a semi-fixed sequence of attacks: After that she behaves similar to her first phase. She casts Blood Orb Creation whenever its 15s cooldown is ready and otherwise randomly chooses between Melee Combo, Flight (~20s cooldown), and Shadow Clone (~20s cooldown). During this part of the fight, the only threatening attack Lilith has is Shadow Clone, but with plenty of space to dodge it, you can always run in a big circle and be completely fine. Instead, you should focus at dealing damage and managing Blood Orbs. When the Blood Orb Creation is coming up, move next to (or even inside of) one of the existing Blood Orbs to make sure that their numbers don't increase. Staggering Lilith at this stage is also beneficial as it will destroy some of the Blood Orbs. Alternatively, you can just run to the top of the arena to spawn new Blood Orbs, as this section of the arena will soon be destroyed. This, however, makes the next phase transition very hard to survive, so only do this if you have an Invulnerability skill to help you. After Lilith's HP falls below 85% she will finish her current attack and use Flight (bottom to top). After that, she performs a special move (Lilith can't be Staggered during this time) where she uses her wings to destroy part of the arena. This section overlaps with the safe zone of previously used Flight and players standing on it take minor damage over time. 6 seconds later, the cut-off section crumbles down into the abyss, instantly killing all players standing on it. While the platform is crumbling and for 2 second after, Blood Orbs shoot Souls at the player. 2 Souls are created each second, regardless of the number of currently active Blood Orbs. Souls move at ~133% Movement Speed and home in on their target, but their turn speed is very low, making it possible to sidestep them. Souls deal heavy damage on contact. After the platform is broken, Lilith teleports to the center of arena and uses Ground Slam. Dodging all these attacks can be tricky but it becomes much easier if you can outrun the Souls. Then you just have to run in a large circle, timing it in such a way that you enter the crumbling platform right before the blood on the floor starts burning, and then leave it before it falls down, all without stopping. In this case, you only have to worry about the Souls coming straight at you and you Evade or simply take a step to the side to dodge them. Be aware that the pull from the Ground Slam attack will happen while there's still some Souls out, so you need to make sure that there are no Souls between you and arena's center when it happens (or simply use Unstoppable ability to prevent the pull). The second stage of the fight is no different from the first one, but now Lilith has one more ability to choose from: Ground Slam. The next stage begins when Lilith HP falls below 60% mark. Lilith will once again open up with Flight (bottom left to top right) and then will start breaking off the corner of the platform. Unlike the first time, the safe zone of Flight doesn't perfectly overlap with the crumbling platform and there's some burning blood in the left corner of it. There's nothing different in the way you dodge this attack but it's a bit more difficult because the safe zone and the arena itself is now smaller. After the platform is broken, Lilith will teleport to the center and use Ground Slam. During this stage of the fight, Lilith doesn't gain any new abilities but she gets some upgrades: When Lilith falls below 30% HP, she will break the last corner of the platform, starting with Flight (bottom right to top left), then platform break with all the bells whistles and Souls. As she destroys the last platform, she will cast Shadow Clone. After this, the fight continues but Lilith now has no cooldown on her Flight ability and will often use it twice in a row in opposite directions, forcing you to run from one end of the arena to the other and stand in a tiny safe zone while dodging all the Souls coming for you. On top of that, the arena itself is so small now that you barely have space to dodge her Ground Slam and Shadow Clone attacks. Needless to say, staying alive and dealing damage is extremely difficult so it's recommended to Stagger Lilith either right before or right after the last transition and then deal as much damage as possible to shorten this stage of the fight or even outright kill her. The above description of the fight tells you what happens if you slowly and steadily deal damage to Lilith and she has plenty of time to perform all her special attacks. Things can be very different if your damage is overwhelmingly high and certain parts of the fight can be outright skipped. For example, if you deal 60% of Lilith's HP in one hit at the beginning of the fight, she will go up and then come down to summon Oppressors, and you will never have to fight any Enforcers. Now, most builds can't do that kind of damage but that's where Stagger comes in. Staggering Lilith lets you deal damage to her for 5 seconds uninterrupted and many builds can deal serious damage during that timeframe. If you Stagger her before she gets below 70% HP and then kill her before Stagger ends, you skip the most difficult parts of the first phase. If you manage to build stagger fast enough to Stagger her during the opening sequence of attacks, then you can finish the fight without dodging once. Depending on your damage output you can aim to stagger her at different HP thresholds: To manipulate the moment when Stagger happens you need to adjust the amount of stagger damage your build deals. There's two ways to do that: If you lack the damage to skip parts of the fight within one stagger, you can swap your gear during the fight. For example, you can use to build up Stagger and then switch to offensive gloves and during the Stagger. Reviewed by"

    "content": "This version is available when Lilith is below 40% HP. The general method of dodging remains the same: you need to get to one side of the circle so that the attack is aimed off-center, and then quickly dash to the safe area on the opposite site. If you stay in the middle lane while doing that, don't forget about incoming wave that will come a few seconds later. Move left or right when the side waves pass you. If you fail to get to the edge of the arena in time, there might be no safe zones at all and then only Invulnerability can save you. Lilith plunges her tail into the ground while siphoning blood out of the player at the same time, dealing unavoidable damage and creating 8 Dancing Blood Orbs going around the player in two concentric circles. After a brief delay an explosion of blood goes off next to the player dealing damage and creating a new Blood Orb in the center. All previously created Blood Orbs caught in the explosion are destroyed. Dancing Blood Orbs deal minor damage and make the player Vulnerable for 2.5 seconds upon impact. After orbiting the player's original position for 5 seconds, Dancing Blood Orbs swiftly fly out of the arena. In this phase, Blood Orbs are not enemies but obstacles on the map. Stepping into a Blood Orb deals low damage over time to the player and slows them. During certain attacks in this phase, Blood Orbs create deadly Red Souls that chase down the player. If Lilith is Staggered, all Blood Orbs except two (selected at random) are destroyed. This attack applies a stacking debuff to the player, which increases its damage by 2% per stack. The initial hit and the blood explosion apply 2 stacks and each Dancing Blood Orb applies 1 stack on hit. The initial hit is unavoidable. Its damage grows over time, so you need to have enough DPS to end the fight before you accumulate too many stacks of the debuff. The explosion deals high damage but it's easy to dodge with Evade if you remember it's coming. This version of the attack does the same initial damage and creates Dancing Blood Orbs, but instead of creating a single blood explosion next to the player 4 explosions happen in different corners of the arena and 4 Blood Orbs are created. This version is used at the beginning of the second phase when there are no active Blood Orbs on the arena. It can be skipped completely if you manage to take Lilith below 85% health before she spawns them, making this entire phase significantly easier. Lilith strikes the player 1-3 times with her tail. Similar to first phase, the damage of this attack is so low that most builds can just facetank it and use it as an opportunity to deal damage. Lilith flies up into the air and pulls all enemies towards herself while slowing them for 3 seconds. At the same time, she summons 4-6 (depending on her HP) Children of Lilith. After a 2 second delay, Lilith slams down onto the ground, dealing lethal damage in a large circle. Children of Lilith are a ghoul type enemies who pose no threat on their own but can become a source of Souls during certain attacks. If you get hit by the pull + slow you won't be able to get out of the AoE by just running. You need to use an ability to prevent the pull or to remove the slow. Alternatively, you can use a mobility skill or 2-3 Evade charges to get out even while slowed. After dodging, kill the Children before continuing to fight Lilith. Lilith lets out a scream, knocking the player back. After that, Lilith dashes towards the player and shoots a three-pronged fork of shadows at the player, which deals heavy damage. Then she does this dash + fork combo a second time. At the same time, a shadow clone of Lilith is created nearby, which mimics her initial scream and two fork attacks with a 1 second delay. After all 4 forks are shot, Lilith slams the ground near player's position, releasing a massive shadow explosion that deals lethal damage. If Lilith is killed or Staggered during this attack, the shadow clone will continue acting on its own. Since Lilith's death animation is very long, you will receive no rewards for double KO. Very tanky builds can survive a single hit by a fork, but most have to dodge this attack entirely. To do that, move away from Lilith and run in a large circle. Each fork's middle prong is always aimed directly at you, so you will always dodge it as long as you move laterally. In doing so, you risk running into one of the side prongs, so you need to either be far enough away from Lilith or slow down a bit after you dodge the middle one.

Be aware that the pull from the Ground Slam attack will happen while there's still some Souls out, so you need to make sure that there are no Souls between you and arena's center when it happens (or simply use Unstoppable ability to prevent the pull). The second stage of the fight is no different from the first one, but now Lilith has one more ability to choose from: Ground Slam. The next stage begins when Lilith HP falls below 60% mark. Lilith will once again open up with Flight (bottom left to top right) and then will start breaking off the corner of the platform. Unlike the first time, the safe zone of Flight doesn't perfectly overlap with the crumbling platform and there's some burning blood in the left corner of it. There's nothing different in the way you dodge this attack but it's a bit more difficult because the safe zone and the arena itself is now smaller. After the platform is broken, Lilith will teleport to the center and use Ground Slam. During this stage of the fight, Lilith doesn't gain any new abilities but she gets some upgrades: When Lilith falls below 30% HP, she will break the last corner of the platform, starting with Flight (bottom right to top left), then platform break with all the bells whistles and Souls. As she destroys the last platform, she will cast Shadow Clone. After this, the fight continues but Lilith now has no cooldown on her Flight ability and will often use it twice in a row in opposite directions, forcing you to run from one end of the arena to the other and stand in a tiny safe zone while dodging all the Souls coming for you. On top of that, the arena itself is so small now that you barely have space to dodge her Ground Slam and Shadow Clone attacks. Needless to say, staying alive and dealing damage is extremely difficult so it's recommended to Stagger Lilith either right before or right after the last transition and then deal as much damage as possible to shorten this stage of the fight or even outright kill her. The above description of the fight tells you what happens if you slowly and steadily deal damage to Lilith and she has plenty of time to perform all her special attacks. Things can be very different if your damage is overwhelmingly high and certain parts of the fight can be outright skipped. For example, if you deal 60% of Lilith's HP in one hit at the beginning of the fight, she will go up and then come down to summon Oppressors, and you will never have to fight any Enforcers. Now, most builds can't do that kind of damage but that's where Stagger comes in. Staggering Lilith lets you deal damage to her for 5 seconds uninterrupted and many builds can deal serious damage during that timeframe. If you Stagger her before she gets below 70% HP and then kill her before Stagger ends, you skip the most difficult parts of the first phase. If you manage to build stagger fast enough to Stagger her during the opening sequence of attacks, then you can finish the fight without dodging once. Depending on your damage output you can aim to stagger her at different HP thresholds: To manipulate the moment when Stagger happens you need to adjust the amount of stagger damage your build deals. There's two ways to do that: If you lack the damage to skip parts of the fight within one stagger, you can swap your gear during the fight. For example, you can use to build up Stagger and then switch to offensive gloves and during the Stagger. Reviewed by"

    "content": "If you fail to get to the edge of the arena in time, there might be no safe zones at all and then only Invulnerability can save you. Lilith plunges her tail into the ground while siphoning blood out of the player at the same time, dealing unavoidable damage and creating 8 Dancing Blood Orbs going around the player in two concentric circles. After a brief delay an explosion of blood goes off next to the player dealing damage and creating a new Blood Orb in the center. All previously created Blood Orbs caught in the explosion are destroyed. Dancing Blood Orbs deal minor damage and make the player Vulnerable for 2.5 seconds upon impact. After orbiting the player's original position for 5 seconds, Dancing Blood Orbs swiftly fly out of the arena. In this phase, Blood Orbs are not enemies but obstacles on the map. Stepping into a Blood Orb deals low damage over time to the player and slows them. During certain attacks in this phase, Blood Orbs create deadly Red Souls that chase down the player. If Lilith is Staggered, all Blood Orbs except two (selected at random) are destroyed. This attack applies a stacking debuff to the player, which increases its damage by 2% per stack. The initial hit and the blood explosion apply 2 stacks and each Dancing Blood Orb applies 1 stack on hit. The initial hit is unavoidable. Its damage grows over time, so you need to have enough DPS to end the fight before you accumulate too many stacks of the debuff. The explosion deals high damage but it's easy to dodge with Evade if you remember it's coming. This version of the attack does the same initial damage and creates Dancing Blood Orbs, but instead of creating a single blood explosion next to the player 4 explosions happen in different corners of the arena and 4 Blood Orbs are created. This version is used at the beginning of the second phase when there are no active Blood Orbs on the arena. It can be skipped completely if you manage to take Lilith below 85% health before she spawns them, making this entire phase significantly easier. Lilith strikes the player 1-3 times with her tail. Similar to first phase, the damage of this attack is so low that most builds can just facetank it and use it as an opportunity to deal damage. Lilith flies up into the air and pulls all enemies towards herself while slowing them for 3 seconds. At the same time, she summons 4-6 (depending on her HP) Children of Lilith. After a 2 second delay, Lilith slams down onto the ground, dealing lethal damage in a large circle. Children of Lilith are a ghoul type enemies who pose no threat on their own but can become a source of Souls during certain attacks. If you get hit by the pull + slow you won't be able to get out of the AoE by just running. You need to use an ability to prevent the pull or to remove the slow. Alternatively, you can use a mobility skill or 2-3 Evade charges to get out even while slowed. After dodging, kill the Children before continuing to fight Lilith. Lilith lets out a scream, knocking the player back. After that, Lilith dashes towards the player and shoots a three-pronged fork of shadows at the player, which deals heavy damage. Then she does this dash + fork combo a second time. At the same time, a shadow clone of Lilith is created nearby, which mimics her initial scream and two fork attacks with a 1 second delay. After all 4 forks are shot, Lilith slams the ground near player's position, releasing a massive shadow explosion that deals lethal damage. If Lilith is killed or Staggered during this attack, the shadow clone will continue acting on its own. Since Lilith's death animation is very long, you will receive no rewards for double KO. Very tanky builds can survive a single hit by a fork, but most have to dodge this attack entirely. To do that, move away from Lilith and run in a large circle. Each fork's middle prong is always aimed directly at you, so you will always dodge it as long as you move laterally. In doing so, you risk running into one of the side prongs, so you need to either be far enough away from Lilith or slow down a bit after you dodge the middle one. When Lilith raises her wings before the final part of the attack, move quickly to the opposite side of the arena to avoid the explosion. Lilith flies up and leaves the arena. After a brief delay, she comes back flying across the entire battlefield, covering the ground behind her in a thick layer of cursed blood. After a 3 second delay, the blood ignites, dealing lethal damage to all enemies caught in it for the next 2 seconds. There's always a safe zone at the side of the arena where Lilith finishes her flight. This attack is trivial to dodge on it's own and only becomes dangerous when combined with Souls chasing down the player. Remember that no damage is done until the blood catches fire, so you don't need to rush into the safe zone immediately. After player enters the arena, Lilith will drop down in the center, knocking the player back and creating a Circle of Doom that limits the size of the playable area. Stepping outside of the circle will deal extremely high damage over time to the player. The fight always starts with the fixed sequence of attacks: After that she will select one of 5 attacks available to her: Lilith will always prioritize Blood Orb Creation if it's not on cooldown. She will never do Melee Combo more than twice in a row. Otherwise the attacks are selected at random. During this stage of the fight, Lilith has long cooldowns on her high-damage attacks, giving you plenty of time to damage her and/or apply Stagger. Be ready to dodge Wave of Spikes or Death From Above when they come and you should be able to get through this stage without much trouble. When Lilith's health goes below 70%, she will finish her attack and summon 2 Enforcers. After that, she will continuously use Death From Above as long as at least one of the Enforcers is alive (but no less than 2 times). Each Enforcer will leave behind 2 Volatile Bloods and  6 Health Potion charges upon death. Enforcers themselves deal almost no damage. Your primary focus should be on dodging the Death From Above spam while killing them. Stay at the edge of the arena and let the Enforcers come to you. Be mindful of their pull attack as it can move you into the one-shot attacks from Lilith. If your build is not great at cleaning up Volatile Blood, try to kill the minions one-by-one and kill the Blood in-between. After you kill both minions, the camera returns to the normal zoom level and the second stage of the fight begins. Lilith's abilities are upgraded: Her attacks, in general, will follow this pattern: Your best strategy is to focus on dodging during steps 1-3 and doing damage during step 4. Since her Blood Orb Creation now has reduced cooldown and still has highest priority, the attack in step 2 will often be Blood Orb Creation. It's recommended to focus on dodging the incoming Death From Above first and killing Volatile Bloods second. Since Volatile Bloods take 12 seconds to detonate, you have plenty of time to kill it without the threat of a one-shot hanging over you. When Lilith's health goes below 40%, she will finish her attack and summon 3 Oppressors. Same as the first minion phase, she will spam use Death From Above as long as her minions live. This phase is not very different from the first one. Now there are 3 minions instead of 2 but they pose little threat and all the danger is coming from now further upgraded Death From Above. Our strategy stays the same: focus on dodging first and killing second. After the minions die, the fight continues with more improvements to Lilith's attacks: During this stage Lilith will simply use Death From Above after every 2-3 attacks giving you little time to deal damage. Stay at the edge of the arena at all times to make dodging easier and slowly work through her HP bar. When Lilith's HP hits 0, the circle created at the start of the fight will disappear and 20 seconds later Echo of Lilith, Mother of Mankind will spawn in the center. Lilith opens up the fight with a semi-fixed sequence of attacks: After that she behaves similar to her first phase. She casts Blood Orb Creation whenever its 15s cooldown is ready and otherwise randomly chooses between Melee Combo, Flight (~20s cooldown), and Shadow Clone (~20s cooldown). During this part of the fight, the only threatening attack Lilith has is Shadow Clone, but with plenty of space to dodge it, you can always run in a big circle and be completely fine. Instead, you should focus at dealing damage and managing Blood Orbs. When the Blood Orb Creation is coming up, move next to (or even inside of) one of the existing Blood Orbs to make sure that their numbers don't increase. Staggering Lilith at this stage is also beneficial as it will destroy some of the Blood Orbs. Alternatively, you can just run to the top of the arena to spawn new Blood Orbs, as this section of the arena will soon be destroyed. This, however, makes the next phase transition very hard to survive, so only do this if you have an Invulnerability skill to help you. After Lilith's HP falls below 85% she will finish her current attack and use Flight (bottom to top). After that, she performs a special move (Lilith can't be Staggered during this time) where she uses her wings to destroy part of the arena. This section overlaps with the safe zone of previously used Flight and players standing on it take minor damage over time. 6 seconds later, the cut-off section crumbles down into the abyss, instantly killing all players standing on it. While the platform is crumbling and for 2 second after, Blood Orbs shoot Souls at the player. 2 Souls are created each second, regardless of the number of currently active Blood Orbs. Souls move at ~133% Movement Speed and home in on their target, but their turn speed is very low, making it possible to sidestep them. Souls deal heavy damage on contact. After the platform is broken, Lilith teleports to the center of arena and uses Ground Slam. Dodging all these attacks can be tricky but it becomes much easier if you can outrun the Souls. Then you just have to run in a large circle, timing it in such a way that you enter the crumbling platform right before the blood on the floor starts burning, and then leave it before it falls down, all without stopping. In this case, you only have to worry about the Souls coming straight at you and you Evade or simply take a step to the side to dodge them.
