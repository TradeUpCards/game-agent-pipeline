    "content": "Harlequin Crest is one of the Uber Rare Unique items in Diablo 4. It's one of the strongest and most sought after items in the entire game and can be used on every character for a massive boost of +4 to all skills. It also provides major quality of life across the board with Damage Reduction, Cool Down Reduction, Resource Generation & Maximum Life. As mentioned above this item is exceptionally rare and is impossible to target farm or obtain in any way other than luck. It can only drop from monsters that are level 85+ meaning you're going to need to be in late endgame content before it can even start dropping. The drop rate of this and it's fellow Uber Rare Uniques may be adjusted in these early days of Diablo 4 but for now don't get your hopes up. Many Unique items change the way skills and builds work in significant ways. This item is one of the few that is very straight forward and doesn't have any unique mechanics to consider."
