This leads to wild swings in damage depending on which buffs are currently active, how many times you hit each target and how many times you have been hit recently thanks to the stacking buff of Unfortunately, this build's great power comes at the cost of defenses since all of these slots are occupied with mandatory unique items. In addition, it has a relatively high skill ceiling due to the timing of various procs and cooldowns such as , and thanks to performs much better against bosses with additional adds compared to single target encounters. The Starter variant of this build lacks a lot power compared to later ones due to missing things like but should be a solid starting point for getting you into playing the build. I suggest having a Level 15 in a addition to the required items before switching to this build. While it isn't required the reduced cooldown effect will make the build feel much better to play. All in all, the Balazan Thrash Spiritborn is an AoE powerhouse that offers a unique way to play the class and can take on the highest challenges in the game. Let's get started! There are various double-dipping bugs that allow main hall to benefit from damage buffs to the original hit and again for its damage proc. Beware that this build or variants of it include some choices leaning into this interaction, which could be fixed at any moment leading to guide adjustments and a loss of power. However, we believe that a fix to these bugs is very unlikely during Season 9. Known double-dipping interactions occur with the following: The Season 9 theme is the .

At around Paragon 200, leveling slows down significantly and all important nodes and Glyph sockets should be unlocked. Afterwards, you can min/max your build with minor tweaks and by picking up additional smaller nodes. Some Glyph position swaps, board changes and other pathing adjustments may occur as you unlock your full potential. The setup displayed by default is the final version of the build before spending additional points that do not significantly impact your character's power. You can have up to two Runewords in your setup, each consisting of one Rune. Socket them in Two-Handed Weapons if your build calls for them, otherwise place them into your Armor pieces to replace normal gems. The Balazan Thrash Spiritborn focuses on the following combos: As long as you haven't unlocked the final setup or found the top Runes, you can also benefit from these options: are unlocked during the Vessel of Hatred campaign and assist you in battle. There are 4 separate Mercenaries to choose from, each with their own skill trees and abilities. You can have one (permanent) mercenary during solo play and a who assists you from time to time in certain situations.

Alternatively use to cap out your Armor or Attack Speed if necessary. Before you dive into the Endgame with the Balazan Thrash Spiritborn, take a look at this overview of the items used in the build. See below for further details about the different progression steps and variants. Some of your Skill Tree choices depend on what items are available to you. Keep in mind that while we can guarantee that everyone has access to the same Aspects, the exact progression is different for everyone. This section is designed to guide your Balazan Thrash Spiritborn from a fresh level 60 into the very late endgame using the three variants . At the final step, you should be fully decked out with a great all-rounder build. From there, follow the other min/max variants if you want to optimize around certain activities such as This build doesn't have a Maxroll-typical \"Starter\" variant because it requires certain to function. The goal here is to progress through the Torment difficulties as you unlock Ancestrals, Paragon points, all and the most important to pilot this build.

Some are used temporarily to fill slots that may be replaced with more items later on. This Speedfarming variant optimizes the build for easy activities like Tiers after you have finished the variant and reached a plateau in your progression. This setup optimizes the build to push the highest possible Tiers in after you have finished the variant and reached a plateau in your progression. This setup optimizes the build to deal with high end and lair bosses after you have finished the variant and reached a plateau in your progression. Once a guide is released, many players have questions on why and how we are approaching certain choices. In this section you can find the answers to the questions that have been asked the most. The build works really well when you decimate everything in seconds, but may get overwhelmed if fights are long against high level monsters. There are several adjustments you can make when you have trouble with more difficult content: This build has a few key effects that can lead to wild swings in your damage output: Make sure that you invest into and play around all of these as much as possible. This build has no generator, but instead relies on Lucky Hit: Chance to Restore Resource (on weapon) and to generate resource. Make sure to have these properly set up. If you are still struggling, consider running with until you fix it. Generally hardcore and softcore share the same builds. Outside of being more prudent in your gameplay, you can also tweak the setup slightly to raise your survivability: Barrier Generation works with: Barrier Generation doesn't work with: Read up more on Attack Speed in our Bosses are immune to Crowd Control (CC) effects and instead take Stagger Damage when hit by one. The amount of stagger damage dealt depends on the type of CC and is proportional to its duration. After being hit by a CC effect, the Boss will temporarily take less Stagger Damage from a CC of the same type. Effectively, this means that when you're just spamming one type of CC you don't need to spam any more of it than what you need to keep a normal enemy permanently CC-d. To stagger the Boss quickly you need to use as many different types of CC as possible. After the Boss is staggered it gains a certain amount of stacking Stagger Damage Reduction for the rest of the fight: Bosses naturally regain 1% of their Stagger HP every second and when that regen is combined with 90% Stagger Damage Reduction it becomes borderline impossible to Stagger the Boss again unless you bring a serious amount of crowd controls.

The goal here is to progress through the Torment difficulties as you unlock Ancestrals, Paragon points, all and the most important to pilot this build. Some are used temporarily to fill slots that may be replaced with more items later on. This Speedfarming variant optimizes the build for easy activities like Tiers after you have finished the variant and reached a plateau in your progression. This setup optimizes the build to push the highest possible Tiers in after you have finished the variant and reached a plateau in your progression. This setup optimizes the build to deal with high end and lair bosses after you have finished the variant and reached a plateau in your progression. Once a guide is released, many players have questions on why and how we are approaching certain choices. In this section you can find the answers to the questions that have been asked the most. The build works really well when you decimate everything in seconds, but may get overwhelmed if fights are long against high level monsters. There are several adjustments you can make when you have trouble with more difficult content: This build has a few key effects that can lead to wild swings in your damage output: Make sure that you invest into and play around all of these as much as possible. This build has no generator, but instead relies on Lucky Hit: Chance to Restore Resource (on weapon) and to generate resource. Make sure to have these properly set up. If you are still struggling, consider running with until you fix it. Generally hardcore and softcore share the same builds. Outside of being more prudent in your gameplay, you can also tweak the setup slightly to raise your survivability: Barrier Generation works with: Barrier Generation doesn't work with: Read up more on Attack Speed in our Bosses are immune to Crowd Control (CC) effects and instead take Stagger Damage when hit by one. The amount of stagger damage dealt depends on the type of CC and is proportional to its duration. After being hit by a CC effect, the Boss will temporarily take less Stagger Damage from a CC of the same type. Effectively, this means that when you're just spamming one type of CC you don't need to spam any more of it than what you need to keep a normal enemy permanently CC-d. To stagger the Boss quickly you need to use as many different types of CC as possible. After the Boss is staggered it gains a certain amount of stacking Stagger Damage Reduction for the rest of the fight: Bosses naturally regain 1% of their Stagger HP every second and when that regen is combined with 90% Stagger Damage Reduction it becomes borderline impossible to Stagger the Boss again unless you bring a serious amount of crowd controls.

To stagger the Boss quickly you need to use as many different types of CC as possible. After the Boss is staggered it gains a certain amount of stacking Stagger Damage Reduction for the rest of the fight: Bosses naturally regain 1% of their Stagger HP every second and when that regen is combined with 90% Stagger Damage Reduction it becomes borderline impossible to Stagger the Boss again unless you bring a serious amount of crowd controls.
