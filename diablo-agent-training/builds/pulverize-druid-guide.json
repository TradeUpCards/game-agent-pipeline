Additional variants use this as a baseline to optimize around certain activities. This Speedfarming variant optimizes the build for easy activities like Tiers after you have finished the variant and reached a plateau in your progression. The Pulverize Druid is already a monster speedfarmer, but to push the envelope, make the following minor adjustments: This setup optimizes the build to push the highest possible Tiers in after you have finished the variant and reached a plateau in your progression.

Ultimately, . Prior to that, opt for either a 2-handed Mace for the additional Overpower Damage or a Staff for the higher base Attack Speed. Overpower Damage is a conditional damage modifier that turns your damage value for non-critical strikes, and for critical strikes. It has a set 3% probability of occurring normally, but certain skills, passives, and aspects can guarantee that a skill Overpowers. The Pulverize Druid utilizes as many as 4 of these procs: . Unlike Critical Strikes, attacks Overpower per cast rather than per hit, meaning that abilities with multiple hits in one cast Overpower for each hit. As of patch 1.2.0, there is a separate 0%-50%[x] multiplicative damage bonus when you Overpower that scales depending on your current health (with 50% being the max when you are at full health).

The amount of stagger damage dealt depends on the type of CC and is proportional to its duration. After being hit by a CC effect, the Boss will temporarily take less Stagger Damage from a CC of the same type. Effectively, this means that when you're just spamming one type of CC you don't need to spam any more of it than what you need to keep a normal enemy permanently CC-d. To stagger the Boss quickly you need to use as many different types of CC as possible. After the Boss is staggered it gains a certain amount of stacking Stagger Damage Reduction for the rest of the fight: Bosses naturally regain 1% of their Stagger HP every second and when that regen is combined with 90% Stagger Damage Reduction it becomes borderline impossible to Stagger the Boss again unless you bring a serious amount of crowd controls. Druid is a ranged powerhouse pairing incredible AoE-damage at range with massive defenses. With this ranged playstyle, you can dive deep into the Pit. However, the single target can feel underwhelming unless you specialize in Overpower and multiple Uniques. Reviewed by"

Unlike Critical Strikes, attacks Overpower per cast rather than per hit, meaning that abilities with multiple hits in one cast Overpower for each hit. As of patch 1.2.0, there is a separate 0%-50%[x] multiplicative damage bonus when you Overpower that scales depending on your current health (with 50% being the max when you are at full health). This multiplier cannot be increased by any means and is applied to the damage calculation as a global multiplier. In Season 9, all additive damage previously associated with Maximum and Fortified Life is removed. Find out more details in our Bosses are immune to Crowd Control (CC) effects and instead take Stagger Damage when hit by one. The amount of stagger damage dealt depends on the type of CC and is proportional to its duration. After being hit by a CC effect, the Boss will temporarily take less Stagger Damage from a CC of the same type. Effectively, this means that when you're just spamming one type of CC you don't need to spam any more of it than what you need to keep a normal enemy permanently CC-d. To stagger the Boss quickly you need to use as many different types of CC as possible. After the Boss is staggered it gains a certain amount of stacking Stagger Damage Reduction for the rest of the fight: Bosses naturally regain 1% of their Stagger HP every second and when that regen is combined with 90% Stagger Damage Reduction it becomes borderline impossible to Stagger the Boss again unless you bring a serious amount of crowd controls. Druid is a ranged powerhouse pairing incredible AoE-damage at range with massive defenses. With this ranged playstyle, you can dive deep into the Pit. However, the single target can feel underwhelming unless you specialize in Overpower and multiple Uniques. Reviewed by"

As of patch 1.2.0, there is a separate 0%-50%[x] multiplicative damage bonus when you Overpower that scales depending on your current health (with 50% being the max when you are at full health).

The amount of stagger damage dealt depends on the type of CC and is proportional to its duration. After being hit by a CC effect, the Boss will temporarily take less Stagger Damage from a CC of the same type. Effectively, this means that when you're just spamming one type of CC you don't need to spam any more of it than what you need to keep a normal enemy permanently CC-d. To stagger the Boss quickly you need to use as many different types of CC as possible. After the Boss is staggered it gains a certain amount of stacking Stagger Damage Reduction for the rest of the fight: Bosses naturally regain 1% of their Stagger HP every second and when that regen is combined with 90% Stagger Damage Reduction it becomes borderline impossible to Stagger the Boss again unless you bring a serious amount of crowd controls.

Ultimately, . Prior to that, opt for either a 2-handed Mace for the additional Overpower Damage or a Staff for the higher base Attack Speed. Overpower Damage is a conditional damage modifier that turns your damage value for non-critical strikes, and for critical strikes. It has a set 3% probability of occurring normally, but certain skills, passives, and aspects can guarantee that a skill Overpowers. The Pulverize Druid utilizes as many as 4 of these procs: . Unlike Critical Strikes, attacks Overpower per cast rather than per hit, meaning that abilities with multiple hits in one cast Overpower for each hit. As of patch 1.2.0, there is a separate 0%-50%[x] multiplicative damage bonus when you Overpower that scales depending on your current health (with 50% being the max when you are at full health). This multiplier cannot be increased by any means and is applied to the damage calculation as a global multiplier.

The amount of stagger damage dealt depends on the type of CC and is proportional to its duration. After being hit by a CC effect, the Boss will temporarily take less Stagger Damage from a CC of the same type. Effectively, this means that when you're just spamming one type of CC you don't need to spam any more of it than what you need to keep a normal enemy permanently CC-d. To stagger the Boss quickly you need to use as many different types of CC as possible. After the Boss is staggered it gains a certain amount of stacking Stagger Damage Reduction for the rest of the fight: Bosses naturally regain 1% of their Stagger HP every second and when that regen is combined with 90% Stagger Damage Reduction it becomes borderline impossible to Stagger the Boss again unless you bring a serious amount of crowd controls. Druid is a ranged powerhouse pairing incredible AoE-damage at range with massive defenses. With this ranged playstyle, you can dive deep into the Pit.

Ultimately, . Prior to that, opt for either a 2-handed Mace for the additional Overpower Damage or a Staff for the higher base Attack Speed. Overpower Damage is a conditional damage modifier that turns your damage value for non-critical strikes, and for critical strikes. It has a set 3% probability of occurring normally, but certain skills, passives, and aspects can guarantee that a skill Overpowers. The Pulverize Druid utilizes as many as 4 of these procs: . Unlike Critical Strikes, attacks Overpower per cast rather than per hit, meaning that abilities with multiple hits in one cast Overpower for each hit. As of patch 1.2.0, there is a separate 0%-50%[x] multiplicative damage bonus when you Overpower that scales depending on your current health (with 50% being the max when you are at full health). This multiplier cannot be increased by any means and is applied to the damage calculation as a global multiplier.

The amount of stagger damage dealt depends on the type of CC and is proportional to its duration. After being hit by a CC effect, the Boss will temporarily take less Stagger Damage from a CC of the same type. Effectively, this means that when you're just spamming one type of CC you don't need to spam any more of it than what you need to keep a normal enemy permanently CC-d. To stagger the Boss quickly you need to use as many different types of CC as possible. After the Boss is staggered it gains a certain amount of stacking Stagger Damage Reduction for the rest of the fight: Bosses naturally regain 1% of their Stagger HP every second and when that regen is combined with 90% Stagger Damage Reduction it becomes borderline impossible to Stagger the Boss again unless you bring a serious amount of crowd controls. Druid is a ranged powerhouse pairing incredible AoE-damage at range with massive defenses. With this ranged playstyle, you can dive deep into the Pit.

Ultimately, . Prior to that, opt for either a 2-handed Mace for the additional Overpower Damage or a Staff for the higher base Attack Speed. Overpower Damage is a conditional damage modifier that turns your damage value for non-critical strikes, and for critical strikes. It has a set 3% probability of occurring normally, but certain skills, passives, and aspects can guarantee that a skill Overpowers. The Pulverize Druid utilizes as many as 4 of these procs: . Unlike Critical Strikes, attacks Overpower per cast rather than per hit, meaning that abilities with multiple hits in one cast Overpower for each hit. As of patch 1.2.0, there is a separate 0%-50%[x] multiplicative damage bonus when you Overpower that scales depending on your current health (with 50% being the max when you are at full health). This multiplier cannot be increased by any means and is applied to the damage calculation as a global multiplier. In Season 9, all additive damage previously associated with Maximum and Fortified Life is removed. Find out more details in our Bosses are immune to Crowd Control (CC) effects and instead take Stagger Damage when hit by one. The amount of stagger damage dealt depends on the type of CC and is proportional to its duration. After being hit by a CC effect, the Boss will temporarily take less Stagger Damage from a CC of the same type. Effectively, this means that when you're just spamming one type of CC you don't need to spam any more of it than what you need to keep a normal enemy permanently CC-d. To stagger the Boss quickly you need to use as many different types of CC as possible. After the Boss is staggered it gains a certain amount of stacking Stagger Damage Reduction for the rest of the fight: Bosses naturally regain 1% of their Stagger HP every second and when that regen is combined with 90% Stagger Damage Reduction it becomes borderline impossible to Stagger the Boss again unless you bring a serious amount of crowd controls. Druid is a ranged powerhouse pairing incredible AoE-damage at range with massive defenses. With this ranged playstyle, you can dive deep into the Pit. However, the single target can feel underwhelming unless you specialize in Overpower and multiple Uniques. Reviewed by"
