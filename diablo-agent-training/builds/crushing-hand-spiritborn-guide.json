This build relies on and combines extreme speed with high AoE damage by spamming combos of 3x that trigger , resetting all our cooldowns easily and making this one of the fastest speedfarming builds in the game. This build doesn't need much to get started besides one Dungeon Codex Power, but Spiritborn has access to many strong aspects that amplify this build. are powerful legendary effects that buff our damage by stacking armor and block chance. Later on, we include to combine the effects of three separate Spirits to benefit from various synergies. Our resources are solved differently depending on the tools available to us, starting with standard tools like Basic Skills and regeneration, which is later replaced by the combo of . This allows us to permanently crit with massive extra damage on every attack once we reach a high enough resource generation threshold while resetting all our cooldowns in seconds with All in all, the Gorilla Spiritborn represents a fun AoE machine that excels at speedfarming but still packs a punch against tough enemies. Let's get started! The Season 9 theme is the . This season allows you to craft unique using three different components: a , and three through the Seasonal Questline, and can be found while exploring . You choose a Skill as the trigger for your .

At around Paragon 200, leveling slows down significantly and all important nodes and Glyph sockets should be unlocked. Afterwards, you can min/max your build with minor tweaks and by picking up additional smaller nodes. Some Glyph position swaps, board changes and other pathing adjustments may occur as you unlock your full potential. The setup displayed by default is the final version of the build before spending additional points that do not significantly impact your character's power. You can have up to two Runewords in your setup, each consisting of one Rune. Socket them in Two-Handed Weapons if your build calls for them, otherwise place them into your Armor pieces to replace normal gems. The Crushing Hand Spiritborn focuses on the following combos: As long as you haven't unlocked the final setup or found the top Runes, you can also benefit from these options: are unlocked during the Vessel of Hatred campaign and assist you in battle. There are 4 separate Mercenaries to choose from, each with their own skill trees and abilities. You can have one (permanent) mercenary during solo play and a who assists you from time to time in certain situations.

The indicates which affix is most impactful to , and it does not indicate how many you need on that particular affix. Keep in mind that certain stats, such as Armor, Resistances, Extra Size Tempers, Attack Speed, and more, have caps that may affect your priorities according to the items and Paragon points available at that moment. . Alternatively use to cap out your Armor or Attack Speed if necessary. It is critical that fully restores your Vigor every time you hit. If it doesn't you won't do any damage. You need at least 100% resource generation with a perfect 50% roll on . Here are a few data points showing roll and the required Resource generation to fully restore Vigor: This means that a good affix on is required to have a chance of making the combo with work. Resource Generation stacks multiplicatively with each source. In this build sources are: Intelligence, , Paragon nodes on the board. This leaves you with and/or Resource Generation tempers on jewelry to finish the rest. With good endgame gear, one of these is enough, but before that you may need to add extra tempers and masterwork crits to achieve this result. Stacking more Resource Generation after you have reached the critical point no longer provides any benefit, and if you are overshooting, you instead want to go with Resource Cost Reduction (tempers on jewelry), which increases the damage done by consumption effect. Learn more about this interaction in the Before you dive into the Endgame with the Crushing Hand Spiritborn, take a look at this overview of the items used in the build. See below for further details about the different progression steps and variants. Some of your Skill Tree choices depend on what items are available to you. Keep in mind that while we can guarantee that everyone has access to the same Aspects, the exact progression is different for everyone. This section is designed to guide your Crushing Hand Spiritborn from a fresh level 60 into the very late endgame using the three variants . At the final step, you should be fully decked out with a great all-rounder build. From there, follow the other min/max variants if you want to optimize around certain activities such as If you are fresh in Torment 1 coming from a leveling guide, this is where you begin. Since only some Aspects can be guaranteed from Dungeon unlocks for the , focus on acquiring the additional aspects via gambling with The goal here is to progress through the Torment difficulties as you unlock Ancestrals, Paragon points, all and the most important to pilot this build. Some are used temporarily to fill slots that may be replaced with more items later on. This is the final version of the build's progression, including all regular , leaving you with a great all-rounder build for all content in the game. Additional variants use this as a baseline to optimize around certain activities. This Speedfarming variant optimizes the build for easy activities like Tiers after you have finished the variant and reached a plateau in your progression. This setup optimizes the build to push the highest possible Tiers in after you have finished the variant and reached a plateau in your progression. Once a guide is released, many players have questions on why and how we are approaching certain choices. In this section you can find the answers to the questions that have been asked the most. The build works really well when you decimate everything in seconds, but may get overwhelmed if fights are long against high level monsters. There are several adjustments you can make when you have trouble with more difficult content: If there are times when your isn't doing damage it is most likely because you don't fully restore all Vigor between every hit with spends all of your resource to significantly increase the damage of , adds increased AoE and guaranteed a crit. If that doesn't happen at all, you must invest more into resource generation (e.g. tempers, masterworking on jewelry) or get a better ring. It may also be that you only reach the threshold needed when is active and your uptime is too low in boss encounters. Generally hardcore and softcore share the same builds. Outside of being more prudent in your gameplay, you can also tweak the setup slightly to raise your survivability: The most important stat on is the Vigor restore percent! restores 20 - 50% of the Vigor spent in the last two seconds. The ring tracks how much is spent on your buff bar and consumes the buff on your next crit, so you can't scale its effect by attacking quickly. The higher the roll the easier it will be to reach enough resource generation to fully restore your Vigor each attack. If you don't have enough resource generation you will do no damage! To find out how much resource generation your roll needs to fully restore your Vigor follow this formula: Here is a table showing roll and the required Resource generation to fully restore Vigor: When calculating resource generation it is important to remember resource generation is multiplicative. Here is the formula for calculating resource generation: Resource generation = ((100% + Source 1) x (100% + Source 2) x (100% + Source 3) â€¦) - 100% I strongly suggest aiming for a \"chance to hit twice\": \"cast at maximum size\": Resource Cost Reduction: Barrier Generation works with: Barrier Generation doesn't work with: Read up more on Attack Speed in our Bosses are immune to Crowd Control (CC) effects and instead take Stagger Damage when hit by one. The amount of stagger damage dealt depends on the type of CC and is proportional to its duration. After being hit by a CC effect, the Boss will temporarily take less Stagger Damage from a CC of the same type. Effectively, this means that when you're just spamming one type of CC you don't need to spam any more of it than what you need to keep a normal enemy permanently CC-d. To stagger the Boss quickly you need to use as many different types of CC as possible. After the Boss is staggered it gains a certain amount of stacking Stagger Damage Reduction for the rest of the fight: Bosses naturally regain 1% of their Stagger HP every second and when that regen is combined with 90% Stagger Damage Reduction it becomes borderline impossible to Stagger the Boss again unless you bring a serious amount of crowd controls. The setup in the video is still largely the same as the written guide. The Crushing Hand Spiritborn is powerful AoE speedfarmer that nukes everything around it with ease."

To find out how much resource generation your roll needs to fully restore your Vigor follow this formula: Here is a table showing roll and the required Resource generation to fully restore Vigor: When calculating resource generation it is important to remember resource generation is multiplicative. Here is the formula for calculating resource generation: Resource generation = ((100% + Source 1) x (100% + Source 2) x (100% + Source 3) â€¦) - 100% I strongly suggest aiming for a \"chance to hit twice\": \"cast at maximum size\": Resource Cost Reduction: Barrier Generation works with: Barrier Generation doesn't work with: Read up more on Attack Speed in our Bosses are immune to Crowd Control (CC) effects and instead take Stagger Damage when hit by one. The amount of stagger damage dealt depends on the type of CC and is proportional to its duration. After being hit by a CC effect, the Boss will temporarily take less Stagger Damage from a CC of the same type. Effectively, this means that when you're just spamming one type of CC you don't need to spam any more of it than what you need to keep a normal enemy permanently CC-d. To stagger the Boss quickly you need to use as many different types of CC as possible. After the Boss is staggered it gains a certain amount of stacking Stagger Damage Reduction for the rest of the fight: Bosses naturally regain 1% of their Stagger HP every second and when that regen is combined with 90% Stagger Damage Reduction it becomes borderline impossible to Stagger the Boss again unless you bring a serious amount of crowd controls. The setup in the video is still largely the same as the written guide. The Crushing Hand Spiritborn is powerful AoE speedfarmer that nukes everything around it with ease."

Outside of being more prudent in your gameplay, you can also tweak the setup slightly to raise your survivability: The most important stat on is the Vigor restore percent! restores 20 - 50% of the Vigor spent in the last two seconds. The ring tracks how much is spent on your buff bar and consumes the buff on your next crit, so you can't scale its effect by attacking quickly. The higher the roll the easier it will be to reach enough resource generation to fully restore your Vigor each attack. If you don't have enough resource generation you will do no damage! To find out how much resource generation your roll needs to fully restore your Vigor follow this formula: Here is a table showing roll and the required Resource generation to fully restore Vigor: When calculating resource generation it is important to remember resource generation is multiplicative. Here is the formula for calculating resource generation: Resource generation = ((100% + Source 1) x (100% + Source 2) x (100% + Source 3) â€¦) - 100% I strongly suggest aiming for a \"chance to hit twice\": \"cast at maximum size\": Resource Cost Reduction: Barrier Generation works with: Barrier Generation doesn't work with: Read up more on Attack Speed in our Bosses are immune to Crowd Control (CC) effects and instead take Stagger Damage when hit by one. The amount of stagger damage dealt depends on the type of CC and is proportional to its duration. After being hit by a CC effect, the Boss will temporarily take less Stagger Damage from a CC of the same type. Effectively, this means that when you're just spamming one type of CC you don't need to spam any more of it than what you need to keep a normal enemy permanently CC-d. To stagger the Boss quickly you need to use as many different types of CC as possible. After the Boss is staggered it gains a certain amount of stacking Stagger Damage Reduction for the rest of the fight: Bosses naturally regain 1% of their Stagger HP every second and when that regen is combined with 90% Stagger Damage Reduction it becomes borderline impossible to Stagger the Boss again unless you bring a serious amount of crowd controls.

This is the final version of the build's progression, including all regular , leaving you with a great all-rounder build for all content in the game. Additional variants use this as a baseline to optimize around certain activities. This Speedfarming variant optimizes the build for easy activities like Tiers after you have finished the variant and reached a plateau in your progression. This setup optimizes the build to push the highest possible Tiers in after you have finished the variant and reached a plateau in your progression. Once a guide is released, many players have questions on why and how we are approaching certain choices. In this section you can find the answers to the questions that have been asked the most. The build works really well when you decimate everything in seconds, but may get overwhelmed if fights are long against high level monsters. There are several adjustments you can make when you have trouble with more difficult content: If there are times when your isn't doing damage it is most likely because you don't fully restore all Vigor between every hit with spends all of your resource to significantly increase the damage of , adds increased AoE and guaranteed a crit. If that doesn't happen at all, you must invest more into resource generation (e.g. tempers, masterworking on jewelry) or get a better ring. It may also be that you only reach the threshold needed when is active and your uptime is too low in boss encounters. Generally hardcore and softcore share the same builds. Outside of being more prudent in your gameplay, you can also tweak the setup slightly to raise your survivability: The most important stat on is the Vigor restore percent! restores 20 - 50% of the Vigor spent in the last two seconds. The ring tracks how much is spent on your buff bar and consumes the buff on your next crit, so you can't scale its effect by attacking quickly. The higher the roll the easier it will be to reach enough resource generation to fully restore your Vigor each attack. If you don't have enough resource generation you will do no damage! To find out how much resource generation your roll needs to fully restore your Vigor follow this formula: Here is a table showing roll and the required Resource generation to fully restore Vigor: When calculating resource generation it is important to remember resource generation is multiplicative. Here is the formula for calculating resource generation: Resource generation = ((100% + Source 1) x (100% + Source 2) x (100% + Source 3) â€¦) - 100% I strongly suggest aiming for a \"chance to hit twice\": \"cast at maximum size\": Resource Cost Reduction: Barrier Generation works with: Barrier Generation doesn't work with: Read up more on Attack Speed in our Bosses are immune to Crowd Control (CC) effects and instead take Stagger Damage when hit by one. The amount of stagger damage dealt depends on the type of CC and is proportional to its duration. After being hit by a CC effect, the Boss will temporarily take less Stagger Damage from a CC of the same type. Effectively, this means that when you're just spamming one type of CC you don't need to spam any more of it than what you need to keep a normal enemy permanently CC-d. To stagger the Boss quickly you need to use as many different types of CC as possible. After the Boss is staggered it gains a certain amount of stacking Stagger Damage Reduction for the rest of the fight: Bosses naturally regain 1% of their Stagger HP every second and when that regen is combined with 90% Stagger Damage Reduction it becomes borderline impossible to Stagger the Boss again unless you bring a serious amount of crowd controls. The setup in the video is still largely the same as the written guide. The Crushing Hand Spiritborn is powerful AoE speedfarmer that nukes everything around it with ease."

The higher the roll the easier it will be to reach enough resource generation to fully restore your Vigor each attack. If you don't have enough resource generation you will do no damage! To find out how much resource generation your roll needs to fully restore your Vigor follow this formula: Here is a table showing roll and the required Resource generation to fully restore Vigor: When calculating resource generation it is important to remember resource generation is multiplicative. Here is the formula for calculating resource generation: Resource generation = ((100% + Source 1) x (100% + Source 2) x (100% + Source 3) â€¦) - 100% I strongly suggest aiming for a \"chance to hit twice\": \"cast at maximum size\": Resource Cost Reduction: Barrier Generation works with: Barrier Generation doesn't work with: Read up more on Attack Speed in our Bosses are immune to Crowd Control (CC) effects and instead take Stagger Damage when hit by one. The amount of stagger damage dealt depends on the type of CC and is proportional to its duration. After being hit by a CC effect, the Boss will temporarily take less Stagger Damage from a CC of the same type. Effectively, this means that when you're just spamming one type of CC you don't need to spam any more of it than what you need to keep a normal enemy permanently CC-d. To stagger the Boss quickly you need to use as many different types of CC as possible. After the Boss is staggered it gains a certain amount of stacking Stagger Damage Reduction for the rest of the fight: Bosses naturally regain 1% of their Stagger HP every second and when that regen is combined with 90% Stagger Damage Reduction it becomes borderline impossible to Stagger the Boss again unless you bring a serious amount of crowd controls.

Once a guide is released, many players have questions on why and how we are approaching certain choices. In this section you can find the answers to the questions that have been asked the most. The build works really well when you decimate everything in seconds, but may get overwhelmed if fights are long against high level monsters. There are several adjustments you can make when you have trouble with more difficult content: If there are times when your isn't doing damage it is most likely because you don't fully restore all Vigor between every hit with spends all of your resource to significantly increase the damage of , adds increased AoE and guaranteed a crit. If that doesn't happen at all, you must invest more into resource generation (e.g. tempers, masterworking on jewelry) or get a better ring. It may also be that you only reach the threshold needed when is active and your uptime is too low in boss encounters. Generally hardcore and softcore share the same builds. Outside of being more prudent in your gameplay, you can also tweak the setup slightly to raise your survivability: The most important stat on is the Vigor restore percent! restores 20 - 50% of the Vigor spent in the last two seconds. The ring tracks how much is spent on your buff bar and consumes the buff on your next crit, so you can't scale its effect by attacking quickly. The higher the roll the easier it will be to reach enough resource generation to fully restore your Vigor each attack. If you don't have enough resource generation you will do no damage! To find out how much resource generation your roll needs to fully restore your Vigor follow this formula: Here is a table showing roll and the required Resource generation to fully restore Vigor: When calculating resource generation it is important to remember resource generation is multiplicative. Here is the formula for calculating resource generation: Resource generation = ((100% + Source 1) x (100% + Source 2) x (100% + Source 3) â€¦) - 100% I strongly suggest aiming for a \"chance to hit twice\": \"cast at maximum size\": Resource Cost Reduction: Barrier Generation works with: Barrier Generation doesn't work with: Read up more on Attack Speed in our Bosses are immune to Crowd Control (CC) effects and instead take Stagger Damage when hit by one. The amount of stagger damage dealt depends on the type of CC and is proportional to its duration. After being hit by a CC effect, the Boss will temporarily take less Stagger Damage from a CC of the same type. Effectively, this means that when you're just spamming one type of CC you don't need to spam any more of it than what you need to keep a normal enemy permanently CC-d. To stagger the Boss quickly you need to use as many different types of CC as possible. After the Boss is staggered it gains a certain amount of stacking Stagger Damage Reduction for the rest of the fight: Bosses naturally regain 1% of their Stagger HP every second and when that regen is combined with 90% Stagger Damage Reduction it becomes borderline impossible to Stagger the Boss again unless you bring a serious amount of crowd controls. The setup in the video is still largely the same as the written guide. The Crushing Hand Spiritborn is powerful AoE speedfarmer that nukes everything around it with ease."

Outside of being more prudent in your gameplay, you can also tweak the setup slightly to raise your survivability: The most important stat on is the Vigor restore percent! restores 20 - 50% of the Vigor spent in the last two seconds. The ring tracks how much is spent on your buff bar and consumes the buff on your next crit, so you can't scale its effect by attacking quickly. The higher the roll the easier it will be to reach enough resource generation to fully restore your Vigor each attack. If you don't have enough resource generation you will do no damage! To find out how much resource generation your roll needs to fully restore your Vigor follow this formula: Here is a table showing roll and the required Resource generation to fully restore Vigor: When calculating resource generation it is important to remember resource generation is multiplicative. Here is the formula for calculating resource generation: Resource generation = ((100% + Source 1) x (100% + Source 2) x (100% + Source 3) â€¦) - 100% I strongly suggest aiming for a \"chance to hit twice\": \"cast at maximum size\": Resource Cost Reduction: Barrier Generation works with: Barrier Generation doesn't work with: Read up more on Attack Speed in our Bosses are immune to Crowd Control (CC) effects and instead take Stagger Damage when hit by one. The amount of stagger damage dealt depends on the type of CC and is proportional to its duration. After being hit by a CC effect, the Boss will temporarily take less Stagger Damage from a CC of the same type. Effectively, this means that when you're just spamming one type of CC you don't need to spam any more of it than what you need to keep a normal enemy permanently CC-d. To stagger the Boss quickly you need to use as many different types of CC as possible. After the Boss is staggered it gains a certain amount of stacking Stagger Damage Reduction for the rest of the fight: Bosses naturally regain 1% of their Stagger HP every second and when that regen is combined with 90% Stagger Damage Reduction it becomes borderline impossible to Stagger the Boss again unless you bring a serious amount of crowd controls.
