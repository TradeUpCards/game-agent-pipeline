The amount of stagger damage dealt depends on the type of CC and is proportional to its duration. After being hit by a CC effect, the Boss will temporarily take less Stagger Damage from a CC of the same type. Effectively, this means that when you're just spamming one type of CC you don't need to spam any more of it than what you need to keep a normal enemy permanently CC-d. To stagger the Boss quickly you need to use as many different types of CC as possible. After the Boss is staggered it gains a certain amount of stacking Stagger Damage Reduction for the rest of the fight: Bosses naturally regain 1% of their Stagger HP every second and when that regen is combined with 90% Stagger Damage Reduction it becomes borderline impossible to Stagger the Boss again unless you bring a serious amount of crowd controls. Coming Soon. The Arc Lash Sorcerer Endgame build is an aggressive melee powerhouse, once you get the right gear. While you will be on the front line, Sorcerer gets plenty of defensive skills to keep you healthy."

To stagger the Boss quickly you need to use as many different types of CC as possible. After the Boss is staggered it gains a certain amount of stacking Stagger Damage Reduction for the rest of the fight: Bosses naturally regain 1% of their Stagger HP every second and when that regen is combined with 90% Stagger Damage Reduction it becomes borderline impossible to Stagger the Boss again unless you bring a serious amount of crowd controls. Coming Soon. The Arc Lash Sorcerer Endgame build is an aggressive melee powerhouse, once you get the right gear. While you will be on the front line, Sorcerer gets plenty of defensive skills to keep you healthy. Maxroll Media Group, All Rights Reserved"
