    "content": "Welcome to the Cataclysm Druid Endgame Guide! The Druid distinguishes itself by significantly boosting its destructive power through guaranteed Overpowers. This build stands out as a prolific speedfarmer, but requires specific gear to get started and has a playstyle that takes some getting used to, especially when Bossing. To be transparent, this build is nerfed considerably from Season 8. had their multipliers significantly reduced and no longer has additive damage scaling based on Maximum and Fortified Life. Further, a rework to gives the build very stringent Cooldown requirements. All in all, the Cataclysm Druid still accomplishes plenty, but it is no longer miles ahead of the competition. Guaranteeing Overpowers is possible by synchronizing casts of with a fully stacked , and Critical Strike Chance is capped through Gear, Tempers, and Runes. Use one or more of to group mobs tightly together and overlap Strikes to improve damage. To get the build off the ground, it's imperative to acquire the build's core allows for some of the build's best available multipliers through itself, enables a host of synergies, including activating the Legendary Node and enabling groups mobs together and crucially has a high roll of Ultimate Cooldown Reduction. This guide will teach you all you need to know about the Druid. Let's get started! The Season 9 theme is the . This season allows you to craft unique using three different components: a , and three through the Seasonal Questline, and can be found while exploring . You choose a Skill as the trigger for your . Once in Torment I or higher, can be crafted, which replace the Gems in your Jewelry, adding additional power to your build. - The periodic grouping effect from this Catalyst is tough to beat. Bind it to - A little bit of extra toughness. . Be mindful of this as you prepare for the next combo to avoid massive DPS downtimes. : At max rank, has an 11.2 second Cooldown. So, watching for your Catalyst to become active on your skill bar can be a great way to track , as you normally cast at least once per rotation to pause Provocation and sync the two. Pit bosses can admittedly prove to be a challenge, and the optimal damage scenario takes some practice to realize. To maximize single target damage, your goal is to lure the Boss to one of the edges of the arena, then move to a position where you are practically within their hitbox. In essence, the aim is to minimize the area that random strikes can land and attempt to concentrate as many of them as possible onto the Boss, bypassing restriction of hitting the same target just once every .5 seconds. But since the arenas vary in shape, and some bosses drift backwards ( ) while others follow you promptly ( ), there's no one-size-fits-all tactic. Druids can choose 5 out of 16 Passive bonuses (Boons) from 4 different spirits. You have to bond with one of the Spirits in to activate two of its Boons. The remaining Spirits can only have one Boon each. Use the following Boons: Bond with the and activate Use the slider to see the progression steps. At around Paragon 200, leveling slows down significantly and all important nodes and Glyph sockets should be unlocked. Afterwards, you can min/max your build with minor tweaks and by picking up additional smaller nodes. You can have up to two Runewords in your setup, each consisting of one Rune. Socket them in Two-Handed Weapons if your build calls for them, otherwise place them into your Armor pieces to replace normal gems. The Cataclysm Druid focuses on the following combos: If you haven't unlocked the final setup or found the top runes, you can also benefit from these options: are unlocked during the Vessel of Hatred campaign and assist you in battle. There are 4 separate Mercenaries to choose from, each with their own skill trees and abilities. You can have one (permanent) mercenary during solo play and a who assists you from time to time in certain situations. He provides you with passive All Resistance, an area of effect Slow which increases your damage, a 90% damage reduction bubble that also increases damage, and prevents you from getting one shot every 30 seconds thanks to . Beware that he's not present when playing in groups and make sure you remain resistance capped without him. for an AoE damage reduction. To enable the Cataclysm Druid to perform optimally, hunt for these stats on your gear with good rolls and aim to them accordingly. The indicates which affix is most impactful to , and it does not indicate how many you need on that particular affix. Keep in mind that certain stats, such as Armor, Resistances, Extra Size Tempers, Attack Speed, and more, have caps that may affect your priorities according to the items and Paragon points available at that moment. Before you dive into the endgame with the Cataclysm Druid, take a look at this overview of the items used in the build. See below for further details about the different progression steps and variants. Some of your Skill Tree choices depend on what items are available to you. Keep in mind that while we can guarantee that everyone has access to the same Aspects, the exact progression is different for everyone. This section is designed to guide your Cataclysm Druid from a fresh level 60 into the very late endgame using the three variants . At the final step, you should be fully decked out with a great all-rounder build. From there, follow the other min/max variants if you want to optimize around certain activities such as The goal here is to progress through the Torment difficulties as you unlock Ancestrals, Paragon points, all and the most important to pilot this build. Some are used temporarily to fill slots that may be replaced with more items later on. This is the final version of the build's progression, including all regular , leaving you with a great all-rounder build for all content in the game. Additional variants use this as a baseline to optimize around certain activities. This Speedfarming variant optimizes the build for easy activities like Tiers after you have finished the variant and reached a plateau in your progression. This setup optimizes the build to push the highest possible Tiers in after you have finished the variant and reached a plateau in your progression. The Pit Push variant is quite similar to the variant, with just a couple changes: Once a guide is released, many players have questions on why and how we are approaching certain choices. In this section you can find the answers to the questions that have been asked the most. You get a continuous overlap on through a combination of Cooldown Reduction and Duration: The build works really well when you decimate everything in seconds, but may get overwhelmed if fights are long against high level monsters. There are several adjustments you can make when you have trouble with more difficult content: Druids have only two non-Ultimate sources of . If you're not subscribed to their long Cooldown, is a great alternative to those skills. Generally hardcore and softcore share the same builds. Outside of being more prudent in your gameplay, you can also tweak the setup slightly to raise your survivability: Bosses are immune to Crowd Control (CC) effects and instead take Stagger Damage when hit by one. The amount of stagger damage dealt depends on the type of CC and is proportional to its duration. After being hit by a CC effect, the Boss will temporarily take less Stagger Damage from a CC of the same type. Effectively, this means that when you're just spamming one type of CC you don't need to spam any more of it than what you need to keep a normal enemy permanently CC-d. To stagger the Boss quickly you need to use as many different types of CC as possible. After the Boss is staggered it gains a certain amount of stacking Stagger Damage Reduction for the rest of the fight: Bosses naturally regain 1% of their Stagger HP every second and when that regen is combined with 90% Stagger Damage Reduction it becomes borderline impossible to Stagger the Boss again unless you bring a serious amount of crowd controls. Druid is a maelstrom of destruction, capable of almost immediately offscreening lesser foes while obtaining respectable marks in Pit Pushing. The initial snapshot and unintuitive boss mechanics are easy to learn but tough to master. However, the payoff for proper execution is tremendous and catapults the Cataclysm Druid into the upper echelon of Druid builds. Reviewed by"

In this section you can find the answers to the questions that have been asked the most. You get a continuous overlap on through a combination of Cooldown Reduction and Duration: The build works really well when you decimate everything in seconds, but may get overwhelmed if fights are long against high level monsters. There are several adjustments you can make when you have trouble with more difficult content: Druids have only two non-Ultimate sources of . If you're not subscribed to their long Cooldown, is a great alternative to those skills. Generally hardcore and softcore share the same builds. Outside of being more prudent in your gameplay, you can also tweak the setup slightly to raise your survivability: Bosses are immune to Crowd Control (CC) effects and instead take Stagger Damage when hit by one. The amount of stagger damage dealt depends on the type of CC and is proportional to its duration. After being hit by a CC effect, the Boss will temporarily take less Stagger Damage from a CC of the same type. Effectively, this means that when you're just spamming one type of CC you don't need to spam any more of it than what you need to keep a normal enemy permanently CC-d. To stagger the Boss quickly you need to use as many different types of CC as possible. After the Boss is staggered it gains a certain amount of stacking Stagger Damage Reduction for the rest of the fight: Bosses naturally regain 1% of their Stagger HP every second and when that regen is combined with 90% Stagger Damage Reduction it becomes borderline impossible to Stagger the Boss again unless you bring a serious amount of crowd controls. Druid is a maelstrom of destruction, capable of almost immediately offscreening lesser foes while obtaining respectable marks in Pit Pushing. The initial snapshot and unintuitive boss mechanics are easy to learn but tough to master.

If you're not subscribed to their long Cooldown, is a great alternative to those skills. Generally hardcore and softcore share the same builds. Outside of being more prudent in your gameplay, you can also tweak the setup slightly to raise your survivability: Bosses are immune to Crowd Control (CC) effects and instead take Stagger Damage when hit by one. The amount of stagger damage dealt depends on the type of CC and is proportional to its duration. After being hit by a CC effect, the Boss will temporarily take less Stagger Damage from a CC of the same type. Effectively, this means that when you're just spamming one type of CC you don't need to spam any more of it than what you need to keep a normal enemy permanently CC-d. To stagger the Boss quickly you need to use as many different types of CC as possible. After the Boss is staggered it gains a certain amount of stacking Stagger Damage Reduction for the rest of the fight: Bosses naturally regain 1% of their Stagger HP every second and when that regen is combined with 90% Stagger Damage Reduction it becomes borderline impossible to Stagger the Boss again unless you bring a serious amount of crowd controls.

Keep in mind that while we can guarantee that everyone has access to the same Aspects, the exact progression is different for everyone. This section is designed to guide your Cataclysm Druid from a fresh level 60 into the very late endgame using the three variants . At the final step, you should be fully decked out with a great all-rounder build. From there, follow the other min/max variants if you want to optimize around certain activities such as The goal here is to progress through the Torment difficulties as you unlock Ancestrals, Paragon points, all and the most important to pilot this build. Some are used temporarily to fill slots that may be replaced with more items later on. This is the final version of the build's progression, including all regular , leaving you with a great all-rounder build for all content in the game. Additional variants use this as a baseline to optimize around certain activities. This Speedfarming variant optimizes the build for easy activities like Tiers after you have finished the variant and reached a plateau in your progression. This setup optimizes the build to push the highest possible Tiers in after you have finished the variant and reached a plateau in your progression. The Pit Push variant is quite similar to the variant, with just a couple changes: Once a guide is released, many players have questions on why and how we are approaching certain choices. In this section you can find the answers to the questions that have been asked the most. You get a continuous overlap on through a combination of Cooldown Reduction and Duration: The build works really well when you decimate everything in seconds, but may get overwhelmed if fights are long against high level monsters. There are several adjustments you can make when you have trouble with more difficult content: Druids have only two non-Ultimate sources of . If you're not subscribed to their long Cooldown, is a great alternative to those skills. Generally hardcore and softcore share the same builds. Outside of being more prudent in your gameplay, you can also tweak the setup slightly to raise your survivability: Bosses are immune to Crowd Control (CC) effects and instead take Stagger Damage when hit by one. The amount of stagger damage dealt depends on the type of CC and is proportional to its duration. After being hit by a CC effect, the Boss will temporarily take less Stagger Damage from a CC of the same type. Effectively, this means that when you're just spamming one type of CC you don't need to spam any more of it than what you need to keep a normal enemy permanently CC-d. To stagger the Boss quickly you need to use as many different types of CC as possible. After the Boss is staggered it gains a certain amount of stacking Stagger Damage Reduction for the rest of the fight: Bosses naturally regain 1% of their Stagger HP every second and when that regen is combined with 90% Stagger Damage Reduction it becomes borderline impossible to Stagger the Boss again unless you bring a serious amount of crowd controls. Druid is a maelstrom of destruction, capable of almost immediately offscreening lesser foes while obtaining respectable marks in Pit Pushing. The initial snapshot and unintuitive boss mechanics are easy to learn but tough to master. However, the payoff for proper execution is tremendous and catapults the Cataclysm Druid into the upper echelon of Druid builds. Reviewed by"

    "content": ", as you normally cast at least once per rotation to pause Provocation and sync the two. Pit bosses can admittedly prove to be a challenge, and the optimal damage scenario takes some practice to realize. To maximize single target damage, your goal is to lure the Boss to one of the edges of the arena, then move to a position where you are practically within their hitbox. In essence, the aim is to minimize the area that random strikes can land and attempt to concentrate as many of them as possible onto the Boss, bypassing restriction of hitting the same target just once every .5 seconds. But since the arenas vary in shape, and some bosses drift backwards ( ) while others follow you promptly ( ), there's no one-size-fits-all tactic. Druids can choose 5 out of 16 Passive bonuses (Boons) from 4 different spirits. You have to bond with one of the Spirits in to activate two of its Boons. The remaining Spirits can only have one Boon each. Use the following Boons: Bond with the and activate Use the slider to see the progression steps. At around Paragon 200, leveling slows down significantly and all important nodes and Glyph sockets should be unlocked. Afterwards, you can min/max your build with minor tweaks and by picking up additional smaller nodes. You can have up to two Runewords in your setup, each consisting of one Rune. Socket them in Two-Handed Weapons if your build calls for them, otherwise place them into your Armor pieces to replace normal gems. The Cataclysm Druid focuses on the following combos: If you haven't unlocked the final setup or found the top runes, you can also benefit from these options: are unlocked during the Vessel of Hatred campaign and assist you in battle. There are 4 separate Mercenaries to choose from, each with their own skill trees and abilities. You can have one (permanent) mercenary during solo play and a who assists you from time to time in certain situations. He provides you with passive All Resistance, an area of effect Slow which increases your damage, a 90% damage reduction bubble that also increases damage, and prevents you from getting one shot every 30 seconds thanks to . Beware that he's not present when playing in groups and make sure you remain resistance capped without him. for an AoE damage reduction.
