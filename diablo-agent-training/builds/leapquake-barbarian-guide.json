    "content": "Welcome to the Earthquake Barbarian Build Guide! This is a comprehensive guide that focuses on the \"HotA Quake\" setup introduced in Season 7, which uses Hammer of the Ancients and for some seriously dangerous and explosive terrestrial destruction. In Season 9 it is a shadow of its former self in terms of power, but if you like the playstyle, the build is still certainly functional enough for tackling most of what the game has to offer. Earthquakes, as you may have guessed, are what give the build practically all of its power. They are created primarily by utilizing the for the vast majority of the build's progression, but secondary sources include Aspect during early stages, or Aspect for speedfarming. If zooming around like a madman and leaving destructive fissures in your wake sounds like a good time, then this is the build for you. Heck, if body-pulling multiple screens of enemies, hunkering down and then annihilating them all with a titanic swing of the sounds like your idea of a good time... then this build is for you. Don't get too excited yet though -as with most builds, there are some integral pieces that must be acquired first before any Earthquake-focused setup can truly shine: The Season 9 theme is the . This season allows you to craft unique using three different components: a , and three through the Seasonal Questline, and can be found while exploring . You choose a Skill as the trigger for your . Once in Torment I or higher, can be crafted which replace the Gems in your Jewelry, that add additional power to your build. as it has a long duration and is incredibly reliable. As long as you are positioned between the enemy and the , it applies its effects to the target. Infusion is taken for the damage reduction it grants. The Arsenal System allows us to use a specific weapon for every attack skill, with each weapon granting different bonuses. We also have what is called the Technique Slot. With this, we can use any weapon of our choosing to always reap the benefit from, regardless of which weapon we have equipped. For this purpose of this guide, the is our main weapon choice simply because requires it to function. When using the Pit Pushing variant, should also be set to this weapon in order to benefit from both its Enhanced version as well as the specialization. In the Technique Slot, the allows us to deal 10% more damage to enemies. Thankfully, this build has very high uptime, so this is practically a no-brainer. Unfortunately, its secondary effect does not apply here - the limitation of the Technique Slot is that it does not allow us to benefit from the second bonus that is normally gained from reaching rank 10 with any weapon expertise. Use the slider to see the progression steps. At around Paragon 200, leveling slows down significantly and all important nodes and Glyph sockets should be unlocked. Afterwards, you can min/max your build with minor tweaks and by picking up additional smaller nodes. Some Glyph position swaps, board changes and other pathing adjustments may occur as you unlock your full potential. The setup displayed by default is the final version of the build before spending additional points that do not significantly impact your character's power. You can have up to two Runewords in your setup, each consisting of one Rune. Socket them in Two-Handed Weapons if your build calls for them, otherwise place them into your Armor pieces to replace normal gems. The Earthquake Barbarian focuses on the following combos: If you haven't unlocked the final setup or found the top runes, you can also benefit from these options: are unlocked during the Vessel of Hatred campaign and assist you in battle. There are 4 separate Mercenaries to choose from, each with their own skill trees and abilities. You can have one (permanent) mercenary during solo play and a who assists you from time to time in certain situations. helps us cap our Resistances, which is quite difficult to do with gear alone. His Key Passive, , gives us a pretty sizable damage boost while the effects of are active. periodically, which gives us an additional layer of defense. Varyana's is also an option here if Attack Speed is needed, but be aware that too much of this stat can be detrimental when trying to spawn Earthquakes with To enable the Earthquake Barbarian to perform optimally, hunt for these stats on your gear with good rolls and aim to them accordingly. The indicates which affix is most impactful to , and it does not indicate how many you need on that particular affix. Keep in mind that certain stats, such as Armor, Resistances, Extra Size Tempers, Attack Speed, and more, have caps that may affect your priorities according to the items and Paragon points available at that moment. Before you dive into the Endgame with the Earthquake Barbarian, take a look at this overview of the items used in the build. See below for further details about the different progression steps and variants. Some of your Skill Tree choices depend on what items are available to you. Keep in mind that while we can guarantee that everyone has access to the same Aspects, the exact progression is different for everyone. This section is designed to guide your Earthquake Barbarian from a fresh level 60 into the very late endgame using the three variants . At the final step, you should be fully decked out with a great all-rounder build. From there, follow the other min/max variants if you want to optimize around certain activities such as If you are fresh in Torment 1 coming from a leveling guide, this is where you begin. Since only some Aspects can be guaranteed from Dungeon unlocks for the , focus on acquiring the additional Aspects via gambling with The goal here is to progress through the Torment difficulties as you unlock Ancestrals, Paragon points, all and the most important to pilot this build. Some are used temporarily to fill slots that may be replaced with more items later on. This is the final version of the build's progression, including all regular , leaving you with a great all-rounder build for all content in the game. Additional variants use this as a baseline to optimize around certain activities. This Leapquake variant optimizes the build for speedfarming easy activities like Tiers after you have finished the variant and reached a plateau in your progression. Once a guide is released, many players have questions on why and how we are approaching certain choices. In this section you can find the answers to the questions that have been asked the most. to simulate how much Cooldown Reduction you need with your current gear. Much of the information in this section has been carefully and thoroughly tested by and is extracted directly from the .

The new Barbarian unique for Season 7 introduces a new mechanic, in the form of being able to detonate active Earthquakes for their total damage in one big hit by hitting them with a line that shoots out from your character when you use . Lets look at some of the affixes. . When an Earthquake is created the affix rolls a die, and if successful that Earthquake will deal double damage for all of its damage ticks and a subsequent explosion if detonated via the Unique effect. . The explosion damage is based off of the total damage an earthquake would deal over it's duration. So if we were to write out the damage an Earthquake would deal per tick it would look like: is from Earthquakes having a bug that makes them deal double damage compared to their tooltip values, and the represents the damage of 1 tick (4s duration with a tick every 0.5s). The total tick damage of an Earthquake and a detonation is simply written as: which is roughly the same amount when we account for the number of EQ ticks only going up by 1 every step of 12.5% duration, by comparison the explosion damage scales continously with more duration. Each Earthquake tick has a separate roll to cause a Critical Strike on each individual enemy hit, where as an Earthquake detonation just rolls a Critical Strike on each individual enemy hit as it's 1 instance of damage instead of several ticks. , if a multiplier snapshots to an Earthquake for its regular tick damage when that Earthquake is created, it will also be active for the detonation. See the for more information on Earthquake interactions. The unique effect of converts all your damage to Fire damage while you're and provides a Fire damage multiplier on top. The only exception to this is damage which stays as damage but still gets the Fire multiplier on top. All other additive damage sources function as normal. In other words: is a vital mechanic for the Barbarian, securing high uptime with your build is often essential to making your character as powerful as possible.

The total tick damage of an Earthquake and a detonation is simply written as: which is roughly the same amount when we account for the number of EQ ticks only going up by 1 every step of 12.5% duration, by comparison the explosion damage scales continously with more duration. Each Earthquake tick has a separate roll to cause a Critical Strike on each individual enemy hit, where as an Earthquake detonation just rolls a Critical Strike on each individual enemy hit as it's 1 instance of damage instead of several ticks. , if a multiplier snapshots to an Earthquake for its regular tick damage when that Earthquake is created, it will also be active for the detonation.

When an Earthquake is created the affix rolls a die, and if successful that Earthquake will deal double damage for all of its damage ticks and a subsequent explosion if detonated via the Unique effect. . The explosion damage is based off of the total damage an earthquake would deal over it's duration. So if we were to write out the damage an Earthquake would deal per tick it would look like: is from Earthquakes having a bug that makes them deal double damage compared to their tooltip values, and the represents the damage of 1 tick (4s duration with a tick every 0.5s). The total tick damage of an Earthquake and a detonation is simply written as: which is roughly the same amount when we account for the number of EQ ticks only going up by 1 every step of 12.5% duration, by comparison the explosion damage scales continously with more duration. Each Earthquake tick has a separate roll to cause a Critical Strike on each individual enemy hit, where as an Earthquake detonation just rolls a Critical Strike on each individual enemy hit as it's 1 instance of damage instead of several ticks. , if a multiplier snapshots to an Earthquake for its regular tick damage when that Earthquake is created, it will also be active for the detonation.

At the final step, you should be fully decked out with a great all-rounder build. From there, follow the other min/max variants if you want to optimize around certain activities such as If you are fresh in Torment 1 coming from a leveling guide, this is where you begin. Since only some Aspects can be guaranteed from Dungeon unlocks for the , focus on acquiring the additional Aspects via gambling with The goal here is to progress through the Torment difficulties as you unlock Ancestrals, Paragon points, all and the most important to pilot this build. Some are used temporarily to fill slots that may be replaced with more items later on. This is the final version of the build's progression, including all regular , leaving you with a great all-rounder build for all content in the game. Additional variants use this as a baseline to optimize around certain activities. This Leapquake variant optimizes the build for speedfarming easy activities like Tiers after you have finished the variant and reached a plateau in your progression.
