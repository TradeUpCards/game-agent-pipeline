We also have the Technique Slot that allows us to profit from one Expertise effect of our choosing at any time. The limitation of the Technique Slot is that it does not allow us to benefit from the second bonus that is normally gained from reaching rank 10 with any weapon expertise. For this build, we assign our weapon slots as follows: This allocation is chosen for two reasons. First, we need three different attacks with three different weapons to activate our bonuses, the main combo of this entire build. Second, with a Two-Handed Axe we produce the biggest damage output and that's exactly what we need for to be useful. on the other hand is often used more as a utility skill to apply buffs and debuffs and for dealing with smaller monsters in AoE combat.

If you somehow end up without any charges, consider simply moving on from the current fight while you're waiting for the skill to cool down.
