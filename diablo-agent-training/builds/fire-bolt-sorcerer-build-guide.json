Unfortunately the way this item works makes the build quite clunky: first you have to place down , then shoot enemies with and then you have to wait for them to die because you deal damage over time. On top of that, the damage only gets really high if you hit the same enemy with all 3 right after they split. Effectively that means that this build is very single target oriented even if can technically hit multiple enemies. This build is most suited for Bossing and slow push in high tier Pit. Speedfarming is doable, thanks to pulls from , but it takes a lot more effort and brainpower than builds with proper AoE. The Season 9 theme is the .

Fire Bolt Sorcerer uses the following Enchantments: Use the slider to see the progression steps. At around Paragon 200, leveling slows down significantly and all important nodes and Glyph sockets should be unlocked. Afterwards, you can min/max your build with minor tweaks and by picking up additional smaller nodes. Some Glyph position swaps, board changes and other pathing adjustments may occur as you unlock your full potential. The setup displayed by default is the final version of the build before spending additional points that do not significantly impact your character's power. You can have up to two Runewords in your setup, each consisting of one Rune. Socket them in Two-Handed Weapons if your build calls for them, otherwise place them into your Armor pieces to replace normal gems. The Fire Bolt Sorcerer focuses on the following combos: If you haven't unlocked the final setup or found the top runes, you can also benefit from these options: are unlocked during the Vessel of Hatred campaign and assist you in battle.

The indicates which affix is most impactful to , and it does not indicate how many you need on that particular affix. Keep in mind that certain stats, such as Armor, Resistances, Extra Size Tempers, Attack Speed, and more, have caps that may affect your priorities according to the items and Paragon points available at that moment. In order to reach the above stat thresholds it might be necessary to use consumables: Before you dive into the Endgame with the Fire Bolt Sorcerer, take a look at this overview of the items used in the build. See below for further details about the different progression steps and variants. Some of your Skill Tree choices depend on what items are available to you. Keep in mind that while we can guarantee that everyone has access to the same Aspects, the exact progression is different for everyone. This section is designed to guide your Fire Bolt Sorcerer from a fresh level 60 into the very late endgame using the three variants . At the final step, you should be fully decked out with a great all-rounder build. From there, follow the other min/max variants if you want to optimize around certain activities such as If you are fresh in Torment 1 coming from a leveling guide, this is where you begin. Since only some Aspects can be guaranteed from Dungeon unlocks for the , focus on acquiring the additional aspects via gambling with The goal here is to progress through the Torment difficulties as you unlock Ancestrals, Paragon points, all and the most important to pilot this build. Some are used temporarily to fill slots that may be replaced with more items later on. This is the final version of the build's progression, including all regular , leaving you with a great all-rounder build for all content in the game. Additional variants use this as a baseline to optimize around certain activities. This Speedfarming variant optimizes the build for easy activities like Tiers after you have finished the variant and reached a plateau in your progression. The base Mystic variant is good enough for Speedfarming. It has all the damage and as well as tons of CDR. The only change we make is replacing with another . However going fast is not that useful when to kill enemies we need: This build just cannot kill fast. You can also replace (and move Catalyst to ) since the former is unlikely to be very useful while speedfarming. This setup optimizes the build to push the highest possible Tiers in after you have finished the variant and reached a plateau in your progression. The only change we do for Pit Pushing is replacing . This makes us lose a whole lot of toughness but the ability to group up enemies quickly and tightly is extremely important for this build because it only deals damage in one small point where all 3 can hit the same enemy. Once a guide is released, many players have questions on why and how we are approaching certain choices. In this section you can find the answers to the questions that have been asked the most. The build works really well when you decimate everything in seconds, but may get overwhelmed if fights are long against high level monsters. There are several adjustments you can make when you have trouble with more difficult content: Bosses are immune to Crowd Control (CC) and instead take Stagger Damage when hit by one. The amount of stagger damage dealt depends on the type of CC and is proportional to its duration. After being hit by a CC effect, the Boss will temporarily take less Stagger Damage from CC of the same type. Effectively, this means that when you're just spamming one type of CC you don't need to spam any more of it than what you need to keep a normal enemy permanently CC-d. To stagger the Boss quickly you need to use as many different types of CC as possible. Apart from using different types of CC you can use the same CC from different sources to apply full stagger. These sources are: After the Boss is staggered it gains a certain amount of stacking Stagger Damage Reduction for the rest of the fight: Bosses naturally regain 1% of their Stagger HP every second and when that regen is combined with 90% Stagger Damage Reduction it becomes borderline impossible to Stagger the Boss again. Like all other skills, , meaning you need to stack certain amount of Attack Speed to actually make it cast faster. In this build we have Category 1 Attack Speed from Gear, . For Category 2 we have up to two Pyromancy Attack Speed tempers and Basic Skill Attack speed on . Your final Attack Speed is the sum of all these bonuses with respect to 100% cap in each Category. To not waste any Attack Speed you need to aim for one of the follwing breakpoints: Note: the above values are measured with 1.3% precision. If you have exactly as much Attack Speed, you have the breakpoint. If are at least 1.3% below the stated value, you have the Breakpoint. If you are less than 1.3% below, then you need to check manually. With fully upgraded Ancestral Items it's quite easy to reach 15 frames breakpoint so you should ultimately aim for it. Fire Bolt Sorcerer is a strong build that is, unfortunately, very -dependent and very single-target oriented."

Effectively, this means that when you're just spamming one type of CC you don't need to spam any more of it than what you need to keep a normal enemy permanently CC-d. To stagger the Boss quickly you need to use as many different types of CC as possible. Apart from using different types of CC you can use the same CC from different sources to apply full stagger. These sources are: After the Boss is staggered it gains a certain amount of stacking Stagger Damage Reduction for the rest of the fight: Bosses naturally regain 1% of their Stagger HP every second and when that regen is combined with 90% Stagger Damage Reduction it becomes borderline impossible to Stagger the Boss again. Like all other skills, , meaning you need to stack certain amount of Attack Speed to actually make it cast faster. In this build we have Category 1 Attack Speed from Gear, . For Category 2 we have up to two Pyromancy Attack Speed tempers and Basic Skill Attack speed on . Your final Attack Speed is the sum of all these bonuses with respect to 100% cap in each Category. To not waste any Attack Speed you need to aim for one of the follwing breakpoints: Note: the above values are measured with 1.3% precision. If you have exactly as much Attack Speed, you have the breakpoint. If are at least 1.3% below the stated value, you have the Breakpoint. If you are less than 1.3% below, then you need to check manually. With fully upgraded Ancestral Items it's quite easy to reach 15 frames breakpoint so you should ultimately aim for it.

See below for further details about the different progression steps and variants. Some of your Skill Tree choices depend on what items are available to you. Keep in mind that while we can guarantee that everyone has access to the same Aspects, the exact progression is different for everyone. This section is designed to guide your Fire Bolt Sorcerer from a fresh level 60 into the very late endgame using the three variants . At the final step, you should be fully decked out with a great all-rounder build. From there, follow the other min/max variants if you want to optimize around certain activities such as If you are fresh in Torment 1 coming from a leveling guide, this is where you begin. Since only some Aspects can be guaranteed from Dungeon unlocks for the , focus on acquiring the additional aspects via gambling with The goal here is to progress through the Torment difficulties as you unlock Ancestrals, Paragon points, all and the most important to pilot this build. Some are used temporarily to fill slots that may be replaced with more items later on. This is the final version of the build's progression, including all regular , leaving you with a great all-rounder build for all content in the game. Additional variants use this as a baseline to optimize around certain activities. This Speedfarming variant optimizes the build for easy activities like Tiers after you have finished the variant and reached a plateau in your progression. The base Mystic variant is good enough for Speedfarming. It has all the damage and as well as tons of CDR. The only change we make is replacing with another . However going fast is not that useful when to kill enemies we need: This build just cannot kill fast. You can also replace (and move Catalyst to ) since the former is unlikely to be very useful while speedfarming. This setup optimizes the build to push the highest possible Tiers in after you have finished the variant and reached a plateau in your progression. The only change we do for Pit Pushing is replacing . This makes us lose a whole lot of toughness but the ability to group up enemies quickly and tightly is extremely important for this build because it only deals damage in one small point where all 3 can hit the same enemy. Once a guide is released, many players have questions on why and how we are approaching certain choices. In this section you can find the answers to the questions that have been asked the most. The build works really well when you decimate everything in seconds, but may get overwhelmed if fights are long against high level monsters. There are several adjustments you can make when you have trouble with more difficult content: Bosses are immune to Crowd Control (CC) and instead take Stagger Damage when hit by one. The amount of stagger damage dealt depends on the type of CC and is proportional to its duration. After being hit by a CC effect, the Boss will temporarily take less Stagger Damage from CC of the same type. Effectively, this means that when you're just spamming one type of CC you don't need to spam any more of it than what you need to keep a normal enemy permanently CC-d. To stagger the Boss quickly you need to use as many different types of CC as possible. Apart from using different types of CC you can use the same CC from different sources to apply full stagger. These sources are: After the Boss is staggered it gains a certain amount of stacking Stagger Damage Reduction for the rest of the fight: Bosses naturally regain 1% of their Stagger HP every second and when that regen is combined with 90% Stagger Damage Reduction it becomes borderline impossible to Stagger the Boss again. Like all other skills, , meaning you need to stack certain amount of Attack Speed to actually make it cast faster. In this build we have Category 1 Attack Speed from Gear, . For Category 2 we have up to two Pyromancy Attack Speed tempers and Basic Skill Attack speed on . Your final Attack Speed is the sum of all these bonuses with respect to 100% cap in each Category. To not waste any Attack Speed you need to aim for one of the follwing breakpoints: Note: the above values are measured with 1.3% precision. If you have exactly as much Attack Speed, you have the breakpoint. If are at least 1.3% below the stated value, you have the Breakpoint. If you are less than 1.3% below, then you need to check manually. With fully upgraded Ancestral Items it's quite easy to reach 15 frames breakpoint so you should ultimately aim for it. Fire Bolt Sorcerer is a strong build that is, unfortunately, very -dependent and very single-target oriented."

This is the final version of the build's progression, including all regular , leaving you with a great all-rounder build for all content in the game. Additional variants use this as a baseline to optimize around certain activities. This Speedfarming variant optimizes the build for easy activities like Tiers after you have finished the variant and reached a plateau in your progression. The base Mystic variant is good enough for Speedfarming. It has all the damage and as well as tons of CDR. The only change we make is replacing with another . However going fast is not that useful when to kill enemies we need: This build just cannot kill fast. You can also replace (and move Catalyst to ) since the former is unlikely to be very useful while speedfarming. This setup optimizes the build to push the highest possible Tiers in after you have finished the variant and reached a plateau in your progression. The only change we do for Pit Pushing is replacing . This makes us lose a whole lot of toughness but the ability to group up enemies quickly and tightly is extremely important for this build because it only deals damage in one small point where all 3 can hit the same enemy. Once a guide is released, many players have questions on why and how we are approaching certain choices. In this section you can find the answers to the questions that have been asked the most. The build works really well when you decimate everything in seconds, but may get overwhelmed if fights are long against high level monsters. There are several adjustments you can make when you have trouble with more difficult content: Bosses are immune to Crowd Control (CC) and instead take Stagger Damage when hit by one. The amount of stagger damage dealt depends on the type of CC and is proportional to its duration. After being hit by a CC effect, the Boss will temporarily take less Stagger Damage from CC of the same type. Effectively, this means that when you're just spamming one type of CC you don't need to spam any more of it than what you need to keep a normal enemy permanently CC-d. To stagger the Boss quickly you need to use as many different types of CC as possible. Apart from using different types of CC you can use the same CC from different sources to apply full stagger. These sources are: After the Boss is staggered it gains a certain amount of stacking Stagger Damage Reduction for the rest of the fight: Bosses naturally regain 1% of their Stagger HP every second and when that regen is combined with 90% Stagger Damage Reduction it becomes borderline impossible to Stagger the Boss again. Like all other skills, , meaning you need to stack certain amount of Attack Speed to actually make it cast faster. In this build we have Category 1 Attack Speed from Gear, . For Category 2 we have up to two Pyromancy Attack Speed tempers and Basic Skill Attack speed on . Your final Attack Speed is the sum of all these bonuses with respect to 100% cap in each Category. To not waste any Attack Speed you need to aim for one of the follwing breakpoints: Note: the above values are measured with 1.3% precision. If you have exactly as much Attack Speed, you have the breakpoint. If are at least 1.3% below the stated value, you have the Breakpoint. If you are less than 1.3% below, then you need to check manually. With fully upgraded Ancestral Items it's quite easy to reach 15 frames breakpoint so you should ultimately aim for it. Fire Bolt Sorcerer is a strong build that is, unfortunately, very -dependent and very single-target oriented."

This Speedfarming variant optimizes the build for easy activities like Tiers after you have finished the variant and reached a plateau in your progression. The base Mystic variant is good enough for Speedfarming. It has all the damage and as well as tons of CDR. The only change we make is replacing with another . However going fast is not that useful when to kill enemies we need: This build just cannot kill fast. You can also replace (and move Catalyst to ) since the former is unlikely to be very useful while speedfarming. This setup optimizes the build to push the highest possible Tiers in after you have finished the variant and reached a plateau in your progression. The only change we do for Pit Pushing is replacing . This makes us lose a whole lot of toughness but the ability to group up enemies quickly and tightly is extremely important for this build because it only deals damage in one small point where all 3 can hit the same enemy. Once a guide is released, many players have questions on why and how we are approaching certain choices. In this section you can find the answers to the questions that have been asked the most. The build works really well when you decimate everything in seconds, but may get overwhelmed if fights are long against high level monsters. There are several adjustments you can make when you have trouble with more difficult content: Bosses are immune to Crowd Control (CC) and instead take Stagger Damage when hit by one. The amount of stagger damage dealt depends on the type of CC and is proportional to its duration. After being hit by a CC effect, the Boss will temporarily take less Stagger Damage from CC of the same type. Effectively, this means that when you're just spamming one type of CC you don't need to spam any more of it than what you need to keep a normal enemy permanently CC-d. To stagger the Boss quickly you need to use as many different types of CC as possible. Apart from using different types of CC you can use the same CC from different sources to apply full stagger. These sources are: After the Boss is staggered it gains a certain amount of stacking Stagger Damage Reduction for the rest of the fight: Bosses naturally regain 1% of their Stagger HP every second and when that regen is combined with 90% Stagger Damage Reduction it becomes borderline impossible to Stagger the Boss again. Like all other skills, , meaning you need to stack certain amount of Attack Speed to actually make it cast faster. In this build we have Category 1 Attack Speed from Gear, . For Category 2 we have up to two Pyromancy Attack Speed tempers and Basic Skill Attack speed on . Your final Attack Speed is the sum of all these bonuses with respect to 100% cap in each Category. To not waste any Attack Speed you need to aim for one of the follwing breakpoints: Note: the above values are measured with 1.3% precision. If you have exactly as much Attack Speed, you have the breakpoint. If are at least 1.3% below the stated value, you have the Breakpoint. If you are less than 1.3% below, then you need to check manually. With fully upgraded Ancestral Items it's quite easy to reach 15 frames breakpoint so you should ultimately aim for it. Fire Bolt Sorcerer is a strong build that is, unfortunately, very -dependent and very single-target oriented."

Keep in mind that certain stats, such as Armor, Resistances, Extra Size Tempers, Attack Speed, and more, have caps that may affect your priorities according to the items and Paragon points available at that moment. In order to reach the above stat thresholds it might be necessary to use consumables: Before you dive into the Endgame with the Fire Bolt Sorcerer, take a look at this overview of the items used in the build. See below for further details about the different progression steps and variants. Some of your Skill Tree choices depend on what items are available to you. Keep in mind that while we can guarantee that everyone has access to the same Aspects, the exact progression is different for everyone. This section is designed to guide your Fire Bolt Sorcerer from a fresh level 60 into the very late endgame using the three variants . At the final step, you should be fully decked out with a great all-rounder build. From there, follow the other min/max variants if you want to optimize around certain activities such as If you are fresh in Torment 1 coming from a leveling guide, this is where you begin. Since only some Aspects can be guaranteed from Dungeon unlocks for the , focus on acquiring the additional aspects via gambling with The goal here is to progress through the Torment difficulties as you unlock Ancestrals, Paragon points, all and the most important to pilot this build. Some are used temporarily to fill slots that may be replaced with more items later on. This is the final version of the build's progression, including all regular , leaving you with a great all-rounder build for all content in the game. Additional variants use this as a baseline to optimize around certain activities. This Speedfarming variant optimizes the build for easy activities like Tiers after you have finished the variant and reached a plateau in your progression. The base Mystic variant is good enough for Speedfarming. It has all the damage and as well as tons of CDR. The only change we make is replacing with another . However going fast is not that useful when to kill enemies we need: This build just cannot kill fast. You can also replace (and move Catalyst to ) since the former is unlikely to be very useful while speedfarming. This setup optimizes the build to push the highest possible Tiers in after you have finished the variant and reached a plateau in your progression. The only change we do for Pit Pushing is replacing . This makes us lose a whole lot of toughness but the ability to group up enemies quickly and tightly is extremely important for this build because it only deals damage in one small point where all 3 can hit the same enemy. Once a guide is released, many players have questions on why and how we are approaching certain choices. In this section you can find the answers to the questions that have been asked the most. The build works really well when you decimate everything in seconds, but may get overwhelmed if fights are long against high level monsters. There are several adjustments you can make when you have trouble with more difficult content: Bosses are immune to Crowd Control (CC) and instead take Stagger Damage when hit by one. The amount of stagger damage dealt depends on the type of CC and is proportional to its duration. After being hit by a CC effect, the Boss will temporarily take less Stagger Damage from CC of the same type. Effectively, this means that when you're just spamming one type of CC you don't need to spam any more of it than what you need to keep a normal enemy permanently CC-d. To stagger the Boss quickly you need to use as many different types of CC as possible. Apart from using different types of CC you can use the same CC from different sources to apply full stagger. These sources are: After the Boss is staggered it gains a certain amount of stacking Stagger Damage Reduction for the rest of the fight: Bosses naturally regain 1% of their Stagger HP every second and when that regen is combined with 90% Stagger Damage Reduction it becomes borderline impossible to Stagger the Boss again. Like all other skills, , meaning you need to stack certain amount of Attack Speed to actually make it cast faster. In this build we have Category 1 Attack Speed from Gear, . For Category 2 we have up to two Pyromancy Attack Speed tempers and Basic Skill Attack speed on . Your final Attack Speed is the sum of all these bonuses with respect to 100% cap in each Category. To not waste any Attack Speed you need to aim for one of the follwing breakpoints: Note: the above values are measured with 1.3% precision. If you have exactly as much Attack Speed, you have the breakpoint. If are at least 1.3% below the stated value, you have the Breakpoint. If you are less than 1.3% below, then you need to check manually. With fully upgraded Ancestral Items it's quite easy to reach 15 frames breakpoint so you should ultimately aim for it. Fire Bolt Sorcerer is a strong build that is, unfortunately, very -dependent and very single-target oriented."
