Fair warning, this does turn the build into a bit of a keyboard piano where you are constantly pressing most of your buttons. Another fun feature of this build is that consumes 100% of our Vigor everytime we use it, this gives us damage bonuses from both . In order to fully take advantage of this we need to be able to instantly restore our entire Vigor pool. We do this by getting Item Power 800 Gloves with the affix which lets us restore a percentage of our vigor on lucky hit. We can scale this number to the point that it restores our entire vigor pool by stacking increased resource generation. Finally after all of that we throw into the mix which allows the thorns damage from to both Crit and Overpower, scaling our damage into the stratosphere. Let's jump in and see what it's all about. is a table showing rolls and the required Resource generation to fully restore Vigor as well as how to calculate resource generation. There are various double-dipping bugs that allow main hall to benefit from damage buffs to the original hit and again for its damage proc. Beware that this build or variants of it include some choices leaning into this interaction, which could be fixed at any moment leading to guide adjustments and a loss of power. However, we believe that a fix to these bugs is very unlikely during Season 9. Known double-dipping interactions occur with the following: The Season 9 theme is the .

Thankfully we have Masterworking, which takes this roll all the way up to a number we can actually work with. The higher the roll the easier it is to reach enough resource generation to fully restore your Vigor when you proc the lucky hit. If you don't have enough resource generation you do no damage. To find out how much resource generation your roll needs to fully restore your Vigor follow this formula and round up to the nearest whole number: Here is rough table showing rolls with assuming the item has 12 Masterworking or 12 Masterworking +1 Temper. As well as the required Resource generation to fully restore Vigor on Lucky Hit: Sources of resource generation: When calculating resource generation it is important to remember resource generation is multiplicative. Here is the formula for calculating resource generation: Resource generation = ((100% + Source 1) x (100% + Source 2) x (100% + Source 3) …) - 100% Read up more on Attack Speed in our Bosses are immune to Crowd Control (CC) effects and instead take Stagger Damage when hit by one. The amount of stagger damage dealt depends on the type of CC and is proportional to its duration. After being hit by a CC effect, the Boss temporarily takes less Stagger Damage from a CC of the same type. Effectively, this means that when you're just spamming one type of CC you don't need to spam any more of it than what you need to keep a normal enemy permanently CC-d. To stagger the Boss quickly you need to use as many different types of CC as possible. After the Boss is staggered it gains a certain amount of stacking Stagger Damage Reduction for the rest of the fight: Bosses naturally regain 1% of their Stagger HP every second and when that regen is combined with 90% Stagger Damage Reduction it becomes borderline impossible to Stagger the Boss again unless you bring a serious amount of crowd controls. The Payback is a mediocre movie that reminded me how much I like Bill Duke! I should go watch Predator- err sorry. Payback Spiritborn is a fun build that performs well in almost any scenario.

The build works exceptionally well when you decimate everything in seconds, but it may struggle during longer fights against high-level monsters. There are several adjustments you can make when you have trouble with more difficult content: Payback Spiritborn has multiple ways to trigger up 100% of the time gives you . If your using a later variant of the build you get which gives you the buff from granting you for 6 seconds. Generally hardcore and softcore share the same builds. Outside of being more prudent in your gameplay, you can also tweak the setup slightly to raise your survivability: The most important stat for this build is the affix. At item level 800 starts off with a roll between this roll is not high enough for us to effectively scale it. Thankfully we have Masterworking, which takes this roll all the way up to a number we can actually work with. The higher the roll the easier it is to reach enough resource generation to fully restore your Vigor when you proc the lucky hit. If you don't have enough resource generation you do no damage. To find out how much resource generation your roll needs to fully restore your Vigor follow this formula and round up to the nearest whole number: Here is rough table showing rolls with assuming the item has 12 Masterworking or 12 Masterworking +1 Temper. As well as the required Resource generation to fully restore Vigor on Lucky Hit: Sources of resource generation: When calculating resource generation it is important to remember resource generation is multiplicative. Here is the formula for calculating resource generation: Resource generation = ((100% + Source 1) x (100% + Source 2) x (100% + Source 3) …) - 100% Read up more on Attack Speed in our Bosses are immune to Crowd Control (CC) effects and instead take Stagger Damage when hit by one. The amount of stagger damage dealt depends on the type of CC and is proportional to its duration. After being hit by a CC effect, the Boss temporarily takes less Stagger Damage from a CC of the same type. Effectively, this means that when you're just spamming one type of CC you don't need to spam any more of it than what you need to keep a normal enemy permanently CC-d. To stagger the Boss quickly you need to use as many different types of CC as possible. After the Boss is staggered it gains a certain amount of stacking Stagger Damage Reduction for the rest of the fight: Bosses naturally regain 1% of their Stagger HP every second and when that regen is combined with 90% Stagger Damage Reduction it becomes borderline impossible to Stagger the Boss again unless you bring a serious amount of crowd controls. The Payback is a mediocre movie that reminded me how much I like Bill Duke! I should go watch Predator- err sorry. Payback Spiritborn is a fun build that performs well in almost any scenario.

To stagger the Boss quickly you need to use as many different types of CC as possible. After the Boss is staggered it gains a certain amount of stacking Stagger Damage Reduction for the rest of the fight: Bosses naturally regain 1% of their Stagger HP every second and when that regen is combined with 90% Stagger Damage Reduction it becomes borderline impossible to Stagger the Boss again unless you bring a serious amount of crowd controls.

The amount of stagger damage dealt depends on the type of CC and is proportional to its duration. After being hit by a CC effect, the Boss temporarily takes less Stagger Damage from a CC of the same type. Effectively, this means that when you're just spamming one type of CC you don't need to spam any more of it than what you need to keep a normal enemy permanently CC-d. To stagger the Boss quickly you need to use as many different types of CC as possible. After the Boss is staggered it gains a certain amount of stacking Stagger Damage Reduction for the rest of the fight: Bosses naturally regain 1% of their Stagger HP every second and when that regen is combined with 90% Stagger Damage Reduction it becomes borderline impossible to Stagger the Boss again unless you bring a serious amount of crowd controls.

At item level 800 starts off with a roll between this roll is not high enough for us to effectively scale it. Thankfully we have Masterworking, which takes this roll all the way up to a number we can actually work with. The higher the roll the easier it is to reach enough resource generation to fully restore your Vigor when you proc the lucky hit. If you don't have enough resource generation you do no damage. To find out how much resource generation your roll needs to fully restore your Vigor follow this formula and round up to the nearest whole number: Here is rough table showing rolls with assuming the item has 12 Masterworking or 12 Masterworking +1 Temper. As well as the required Resource generation to fully restore Vigor on Lucky Hit: Sources of resource generation: When calculating resource generation it is important to remember resource generation is multiplicative.

The amount of stagger damage dealt depends on the type of CC and is proportional to its duration. After being hit by a CC effect, the Boss temporarily takes less Stagger Damage from a CC of the same type. Effectively, this means that when you're just spamming one type of CC you don't need to spam any more of it than what you need to keep a normal enemy permanently CC-d. To stagger the Boss quickly you need to use as many different types of CC as possible. After the Boss is staggered it gains a certain amount of stacking Stagger Damage Reduction for the rest of the fight: Bosses naturally regain 1% of their Stagger HP every second and when that regen is combined with 90% Stagger Damage Reduction it becomes borderline impossible to Stagger the Boss again unless you bring a serious amount of crowd controls.

The amount of stagger damage dealt depends on the type of CC and is proportional to its duration. After being hit by a CC effect, the Boss temporarily takes less Stagger Damage from a CC of the same type.

To stagger the Boss quickly you need to use as many different types of CC as possible. After the Boss is staggered it gains a certain amount of stacking Stagger Damage Reduction for the rest of the fight: Bosses naturally regain 1% of their Stagger HP every second and when that regen is combined with 90% Stagger Damage Reduction it becomes borderline impossible to Stagger the Boss again unless you bring a serious amount of crowd controls.

The amount of stagger damage dealt depends on the type of CC and is proportional to its duration. After being hit by a CC effect, the Boss temporarily takes less Stagger Damage from a CC of the same type. Effectively, this means that when you're just spamming one type of CC you don't need to spam any more of it than what you need to keep a normal enemy permanently CC-d. To stagger the Boss quickly you need to use as many different types of CC as possible. After the Boss is staggered it gains a certain amount of stacking Stagger Damage Reduction for the rest of the fight: Bosses naturally regain 1% of their Stagger HP every second and when that regen is combined with 90% Stagger Damage Reduction it becomes borderline impossible to Stagger the Boss again unless you bring a serious amount of crowd controls.

From there, follow the other min/max variants if you want to optimize around certain activities such as The goal here is to progress through the Torment difficulties as you unlock Ancestrals, Paragon points, all and the most important to pilot this build. Some are used temporarily to fill slots that may be replaced with more items later on. This Speedfarming variant optimizes the build for easy activities like Tiers after you have finished the variant and reached a plateau in your progression. This setup optimizes the build to push the highest possible Tiers in after you have finished the variant and reached a plateau in your progression. Once a guide is released, many players have questions on why and how we are approaching certain choices. In this section you can find the answers to the questions that have been asked the most. You can find the previous version of the build One common issue players face with this build is failing to restore Vigor fully after casting . This happens if you don't have enough +% Resource Generation to make fully restores your Vigor when you get a Lucky Hit. The higher the roll is the easier it is to reach enough resource generation to fully restore your Vigor each attack. is a table showing rolls and the required Resource generation to fully restore Vigor as well as how to calculate resource generation. The build works exceptionally well when you decimate everything in seconds, but it may struggle during longer fights against high-level monsters. There are several adjustments you can make when you have trouble with more difficult content: Payback Spiritborn has multiple ways to trigger up 100% of the time gives you . If your using a later variant of the build you get which gives you the buff from granting you for 6 seconds. Generally hardcore and softcore share the same builds. Outside of being more prudent in your gameplay, you can also tweak the setup slightly to raise your survivability: The most important stat for this build is the affix. At item level 800 starts off with a roll between this roll is not high enough for us to effectively scale it. Thankfully we have Masterworking, which takes this roll all the way up to a number we can actually work with. The higher the roll the easier it is to reach enough resource generation to fully restore your Vigor when you proc the lucky hit. If you don't have enough resource generation you do no damage. To find out how much resource generation your roll needs to fully restore your Vigor follow this formula and round up to the nearest whole number: Here is rough table showing rolls with assuming the item has 12 Masterworking or 12 Masterworking +1 Temper. As well as the required Resource generation to fully restore Vigor on Lucky Hit: Sources of resource generation: When calculating resource generation it is important to remember resource generation is multiplicative. Here is the formula for calculating resource generation: Resource generation = ((100% + Source 1) x (100% + Source 2) x (100% + Source 3) …) - 100% Read up more on Attack Speed in our Bosses are immune to Crowd Control (CC) effects and instead take Stagger Damage when hit by one. The amount of stagger damage dealt depends on the type of CC and is proportional to its duration. After being hit by a CC effect, the Boss temporarily takes less Stagger Damage from a CC of the same type. Effectively, this means that when you're just spamming one type of CC you don't need to spam any more of it than what you need to keep a normal enemy permanently CC-d. To stagger the Boss quickly you need to use as many different types of CC as possible. After the Boss is staggered it gains a certain amount of stacking Stagger Damage Reduction for the rest of the fight: Bosses naturally regain 1% of their Stagger HP every second and when that regen is combined with 90% Stagger Damage Reduction it becomes borderline impossible to Stagger the Boss again unless you bring a serious amount of crowd controls. The Payback is a mediocre movie that reminded me how much I like Bill Duke! I should go watch Predator- err sorry. Payback Spiritborn is a fun build that performs well in almost any scenario.
