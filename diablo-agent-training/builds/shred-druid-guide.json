This is the final version of the build's progression, including all regular , leaving you with a great all-rounder build for all content in the game. Additional variants use this as a baseline to optimize around certain activities. This Speedfarming variant optimizes the build for easy activities like Tiers after you have finished the variant and reached a plateau in your progression. This setup optimizes the build to push the highest possible Tiers in after you have finished the variant and reached a plateau in your progression.

The amount of stagger damage dealt depends on the type of CC and is proportional to its duration. After being hit by a CC effect, the Boss will temporarily take less Stagger Damage from a CC of the same type. Effectively, this means that when you're just spamming one type of CC you don't need to spam any more of it than what you need to keep a normal enemy permanently CC-d. To stagger the Boss quickly you need to use as many different types of CC as possible. After the Boss is staggered it gains a certain amount of stacking Stagger Damage Reduction for the rest of the fight: Bosses naturally regain 1% of their Stagger HP every second and when that regen is combined with 90% Stagger Damage Reduction it becomes borderline impossible to Stagger the Boss again unless you bring a serious amount of crowd controls. The Shred Werewolf is easily one of the fastest builds in the game, flying around the battlefield as it dashes from enemy pack to pack. It is one of the best Speedfarming builds, but can also push Nightmare Dungeons and the Pit reasonably well. Shred is at its weakest in single target situations when it can't effectively leverage Stormclaw's Aspect. Reviewed by"

At the final step, you should be fully decked out with a great all-rounder build. From there, follow the other min/max variants if you want to optimize around certain activities such as If you are fresh in Torment 1 coming from a leveling guide, this is where you begin. Since only some Aspects can be guaranteed from Dungeon unlocks for the , focus on acquiring the additional aspects via gambling with The goal here is to progress through the Torment difficulties as you unlock Ancestrals, Paragon points, all and the most important to pilot this build. Some are used temporarily to fill slots that may be replaced with more items later on. This is the final version of the build's progression, including all regular , leaving you with a great all-rounder build for all content in the game. Additional variants use this as a baseline to optimize around certain activities. This Speedfarming variant optimizes the build for easy activities like Tiers after you have finished the variant and reached a plateau in your progression. This setup optimizes the build to push the highest possible Tiers in after you have finished the variant and reached a plateau in your progression. Once a guide is released, many players have questions on why and how we are approaching certain choices. In this section you can find the answers to the questions that have been asked the most. The build works really well when you decimate everything in seconds, but may get overwhelmed if fights are long against high level monsters. There are several adjustments you can make when you have trouble with more difficult content: Early game, go for a Staff, the fastest 2-Hander, to maximize multiplier. is a powerhouse Unique that offers amazing stats and practically allows you to stop optimizing for Critical Strike Chance, so use that when you find it. Generally hardcore and softcore share the same builds. Outside of being more prudent in your gameplay, you can also tweak the setup slightly to raise your survivability: Read up more on Attack Speed in our Bosses are immune to Crowd Control (CC) effects and instead take Stagger Damage when hit by one. The amount of stagger damage dealt depends on the type of CC and is proportional to its duration. After being hit by a CC effect, the Boss will temporarily take less Stagger Damage from a CC of the same type. Effectively, this means that when you're just spamming one type of CC you don't need to spam any more of it than what you need to keep a normal enemy permanently CC-d. To stagger the Boss quickly you need to use as many different types of CC as possible. After the Boss is staggered it gains a certain amount of stacking Stagger Damage Reduction for the rest of the fight: Bosses naturally regain 1% of their Stagger HP every second and when that regen is combined with 90% Stagger Damage Reduction it becomes borderline impossible to Stagger the Boss again unless you bring a serious amount of crowd controls. The Shred Werewolf is easily one of the fastest builds in the game, flying around the battlefield as it dashes from enemy pack to pack. It is one of the best Speedfarming builds, but can also push Nightmare Dungeons and the Pit reasonably well. Shred is at its weakest in single target situations when it can't effectively leverage Stormclaw's Aspect. Reviewed by Maxroll Media Group, All Rights Reserved"
