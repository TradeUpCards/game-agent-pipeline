The amount of stagger damage dealt depends on the type of CC and is proportional to its duration. After being hit by a CC effect, the Boss will temporarily take less Stagger Damage from a CC of the same type. Effectively, this means that when you're just spamming one type of CC you don't need to spam any more of it than what you need to keep a normal enemy permanently CC-d. To stagger the Boss quickly you need to use as many different types of CC as possible. After the Boss is staggered it gains a certain amount of stacking Stagger Damage Reduction for the rest of the fight: Bosses naturally regain 1% of their Stagger HP every second and when that regen is combined with 90% Stagger Damage Reduction it becomes borderline impossible to Stagger the Boss again unless you bring a serious amount of crowd controls. covers the world in a darkness that few demons can survive. It's a DoT build that loves Attack Speed, moving fast, and even has access to one of the few mobility skills the Necromancer has.

Essence per Second (EPS) affix on the Helm, Chest and Boots helps to passively replace Essence as you cast your damage skills. Resource Cost Reduction reduces the cost of every skill by a percentage equal to the total on your gear. Since the base rolls of EPS add up to 12 and the Necromancer regains 3 EPS, you generate a total of 15 per second. To completely replace the Essence loss of 1 cast per second you need 40% Resource Cost Reduction. This would allow you to go \"infinite\", meaning you would never run out of Essence.

The amount of stagger damage dealt depends on the type of CC and is proportional to its duration. After being hit by a CC effect, the Boss will temporarily take less Stagger Damage from a CC of the same type. Effectively, this means that when you're just spamming one type of CC you don't need to spam any more of it than what you need to keep a normal enemy permanently CC-d. To stagger the Boss quickly you need to use as many different types of CC as possible. After the Boss is staggered it gains a certain amount of stacking Stagger Damage Reduction for the rest of the fight: Bosses naturally regain 1% of their Stagger HP every second and when that regen is combined with 90% Stagger Damage Reduction it becomes borderline impossible to Stagger the Boss again unless you bring a serious amount of crowd controls. covers the world in a darkness that few demons can survive.

The second damage component is the DoT AoE pool that's left under the first target hit by your projectile. This is the meat and potatoes of your scalable damage. These pools can stack infinitely and the only limiting factor is your Attack Speed and resource generation. works slightly differently, in that its bolts can pierce (apply damage to multiple targets in a line) and shotgun (all of the bolts that hit a target can apply their damage to them). They also apply a DoT to the target itself rather than an AoE DoT effect. The difference is that monsters walking on top of d4-skill id=481293]Blight's[/d4-skill] pool begin taking damage even if they weren't there initially. Damage Over Time is applied to a target twice per second, over its duration. So the damage of per tic (two tics to a second) is its DoT damage portion divided by twelve, because it deals its damage over six seconds. contributes 7% to your total damage output on this build, due to how strong effect is. Even with 24 Ranks in the skill, it only bumps up to 10% of your total damage output. Because of this, wasting Affixes, Greater Affixes and Masterwork Crits on those affixes does not benefit the build as much as alternatives would.

Other than going slower and paying more attention to threats around you, there are some imporant things to consider: Read up more on Attack Speed in our Read up more on Attack Speed in our Bosses are immune to Crowd Control (CC) effects and instead take Stagger Damage when hit by one. The amount of stagger damage dealt depends on the type of CC and is proportional to its duration. After being hit by a CC effect, the Boss will temporarily take less Stagger Damage from a CC of the same type. Effectively, this means that when you're just spamming one type of CC you don't need to spam any more of it than what you need to keep a normal enemy permanently CC-d. To stagger the Boss quickly you need to use as many different types of CC as possible. After the Boss is staggered it gains a certain amount of stacking Stagger Damage Reduction for the rest of the fight: Bosses naturally regain 1% of their Stagger HP every second and when that regen is combined with 90% Stagger Damage Reduction it becomes borderline impossible to Stagger the Boss again unless you bring a serious amount of crowd controls. covers the world in a darkness that few demons can survive. It's a DoT build that loves Attack Speed, moving fast, and even has access to one of the few mobility skills the Necromancer has.

Resource Cost Reduction reduces the cost of every skill by a percentage equal to the total on your gear. Since the base rolls of EPS add up to 12 and the Necromancer regains 3 EPS, you generate a total of 15 per second. To completely replace the Essence loss of 1 cast per second you need 40% Resource Cost Reduction. This would allow you to go \"infinite\", meaning you would never run out of Essence.
