Druids can choose 5 out of 16 Passive bonuses (Boons) from 4 different spirits. You have to bond with one of the Spirits in to activate two of its Boons. The remaining Spirits can only have one Boon each. Use the following Boons: Bond with the and activate is an option to close Critical Strike Chance gaps. Use the slider to see the progression steps. At around Paragon 200, leveling slows down significantly and all important nodes and Glyph sockets should be unlocked. Afterwards, you can min/max your build with minor tweaks and by picking up additional smaller nodes. Some Glyph position swaps, board changes and other pathing adjustments may occur as you unlock your full potential. The setup displayed by default is the final version of the build before spending additional points that do not significantly impact your character's power. You can have up to two Runewords in your setup, each consisting of one Rune. Socket them in Two-Handed Weapons if your build calls for them, otherwise place them into your Armor pieces to replace normal gems. The Landslide Druid focuses on the following combos: As long as you haven't unlocked the final setup or found the top Runes, you can also benefit from these options: are unlocked during the Vessel of Hatred campaign and assist you in battle. There are 4 separate Mercenaries to choose from, each with their own skill trees and abilities. You can have one (permanent) mercenary during solo play and a who assists you from time to time in certain situations.

The indicates which affix is most impactful to , and it does not indicate how many you need on that particular affix. Keep in mind that certain stats, such as Armor, Resistances, Extra Size Tempers, Attack Speed, and more, have caps that may affect your priorities according to the items and Paragon points available at that moment. Before you dive into the Endgame with the Landslide Druid, take a look at this overview of the items used in the build. See below for further details about the different progression steps and variants. Some of your Skill Tree choices depend on what items are available to you. Keep in mind that while we can guarantee that everyone has access to the same Aspects, the exact progression is different for everyone. This section is designed to guide your Landslide Druid from a fresh level 60 into the very late endgame using the three variants . At the final step, you should be fully decked out with a great all-rounder build. From there, follow the other min/max variants if you want to optimize around certain activities such as If you are fresh in Torment 1 coming from a leveling guide, this is where you begin. Since only some Aspects can be guaranteed from Dungeon unlocks for the , focus on acquiring the additional aspects via gambling with The goal here is to progress through the Torment difficulties as you unlock Ancestrals, Paragon points, all and the most important to pilot this build. Some are used temporarily to fill slots that may be replaced with more items later on. This is the final version of the build's progression, including all regular , leaving you with a great all-rounder build for all content in the game. Additional variants use this as a baseline to optimize around certain activities. This Speedfarming variant optimizes the build for easy activities like Tiers after you have finished the variant and reached a plateau in your progression. This setup optimizes the build to push the highest possible Tiers in after you have finished the variant and reached a plateau in your progression. The Pit Push setup varies considerably from the rest of the guide. At a high level, instead of dealing damage in a larger area with , it focuses on manually casting (at a slower rate and in a smaller area) while leveraging Overpower, something that unfortunately can't do. The Grizzly Rage variant also misses out on mobility, relegating it to Pit Push scenarios. The Pit Push variant uses the Key Passive to bolster Overpower damage and to accelerate its proc rate. Whereas deal most of your damage in the setup, this variant drops completely in favor of additional multipliers from There is a variant for this variant that performs approximately half a Pit tier better but is more difficult to play, and your mileage may vary with this setup. Rather than relying on to pull, you can go for for periodic bursts of damage. For grouping, use . The expected result of these swaps is a slower clear, as pulls less frequently and is noticeably worse at applying your , but higher overall damage that is most apparent with faster Boss kills. Once a guide is released, many players have questions on why and how we are approaching certain choices. In this section you can find the answers to the questions that have been asked the most. You need to use a 2-hander, as the damage multiplier from is absurdly high. Of the available options, a 2-handed Polearm provides the most consistently applicable bonus (except for Pit Pushing; then, use a 1-handed Dagger to fit in more high value Aspects). The build works really well when you decimate everything in seconds, but may get overwhelmed if fights are long against high level monsters. There are several adjustments you can make when you have trouble with more difficult content: Druids have only two non-Ultimate sources of . If you're not subscribed to either, is a great alternative to those skills. Generally hardcore and softcore share the same builds. Outside of being more prudent in your gameplay, you can also tweak the setup slightly to raise your survivability: Aside from having an excellent suite of stats that benefit , the created Tectonic Spikes allow us to generate even more Pillars when we cast either within their range. This amplifies the multiplier from considerably, so it's worthwhile to maintain the Spikes underneath your priority target. Bosses are immune to Crowd Control (CC) effects and instead take Stagger Damage when hit by one. The amount of stagger damage dealt depends on the type of CC and is proportional to its duration. After being hit by a CC effect, the Boss will temporarily take less Stagger Damage from a CC of the same type. Effectively, this means that when you're just spamming one type of CC you don't need to spam any more of it than what you need to keep a normal enemy permanently CC-d. To stagger the Boss quickly you need to use as many different types of CC as possible. After the Boss is staggered it gains a certain amount of stacking Stagger Damage Reduction for the rest of the fight: Bosses naturally regain 1% of their Stagger HP every second and when that regen is combined with 90% Stagger Damage Reduction it becomes borderline impossible to Stagger the Boss again unless you bring a serious amount of crowd controls. The Landslide Druid is an AoE powerhouse with significant Speedfarming and Pit Pushing potential. Its tanky enough to stand in the middle of the fight and continue dishing out damage. Shapeshifting and Poison multipliers are incorporated thanks to , respectively, pushing the damage profile even further. Reviewed by"

This is the final version of the build's progression, including all regular , leaving you with a great all-rounder build for all content in the game. Additional variants use this as a baseline to optimize around certain activities. This Speedfarming variant optimizes the build for easy activities like Tiers after you have finished the variant and reached a plateau in your progression. This setup optimizes the build to push the highest possible Tiers in after you have finished the variant and reached a plateau in your progression. The Pit Push setup varies considerably from the rest of the guide. At a high level, instead of dealing damage in a larger area with , it focuses on manually casting (at a slower rate and in a smaller area) while leveraging Overpower, something that unfortunately can't do. The Grizzly Rage variant also misses out on mobility, relegating it to Pit Push scenarios. The Pit Push variant uses the Key Passive to bolster Overpower damage and to accelerate its proc rate. Whereas deal most of your damage in the setup, this variant drops completely in favor of additional multipliers from There is a variant for this variant that performs approximately half a Pit tier better but is more difficult to play, and your mileage may vary with this setup. Rather than relying on to pull, you can go for for periodic bursts of damage. For grouping, use . The expected result of these swaps is a slower clear, as pulls less frequently and is noticeably worse at applying your , but higher overall damage that is most apparent with faster Boss kills. Once a guide is released, many players have questions on why and how we are approaching certain choices. In this section you can find the answers to the questions that have been asked the most. You need to use a 2-hander, as the damage multiplier from is absurdly high. Of the available options, a 2-handed Polearm provides the most consistently applicable bonus (except for Pit Pushing; then, use a 1-handed Dagger to fit in more high value Aspects). The build works really well when you decimate everything in seconds, but may get overwhelmed if fights are long against high level monsters. There are several adjustments you can make when you have trouble with more difficult content: Druids have only two non-Ultimate sources of .

Outside of being more prudent in your gameplay, you can also tweak the setup slightly to raise your survivability: Aside from having an excellent suite of stats that benefit , the created Tectonic Spikes allow us to generate even more Pillars when we cast either within their range. This amplifies the multiplier from considerably, so it's worthwhile to maintain the Spikes underneath your priority target. Bosses are immune to Crowd Control (CC) effects and instead take Stagger Damage when hit by one. The amount of stagger damage dealt depends on the type of CC and is proportional to its duration. After being hit by a CC effect, the Boss will temporarily take less Stagger Damage from a CC of the same type. Effectively, this means that when you're just spamming one type of CC you don't need to spam any more of it than what you need to keep a normal enemy permanently CC-d. To stagger the Boss quickly you need to use as many different types of CC as possible.

Effectively, this means that when you're just spamming one type of CC you don't need to spam any more of it than what you need to keep a normal enemy permanently CC-d. To stagger the Boss quickly you need to use as many different types of CC as possible.

To stagger the Boss quickly you need to use as many different types of CC as possible. After the Boss is staggered it gains a certain amount of stacking Stagger Damage Reduction for the rest of the fight: Bosses naturally regain 1% of their Stagger HP every second and when that regen is combined with 90% Stagger Damage Reduction it becomes borderline impossible to Stagger the Boss again unless you bring a serious amount of crowd controls.

This Speedfarming variant optimizes the build for easy activities like Tiers after you have finished the variant and reached a plateau in your progression.

The Pit Push setup varies considerably from the rest of the guide. At a high level, instead of dealing damage in a larger area with , it focuses on manually casting (at a slower rate and in a smaller area) while leveraging Overpower, something that unfortunately can't do. The Grizzly Rage variant also misses out on mobility, relegating it to Pit Push scenarios. The Pit Push variant uses the Key Passive to bolster Overpower damage and to accelerate its proc rate. Whereas deal most of your damage in the setup, this variant drops completely in favor of additional multipliers from There is a variant for this variant that performs approximately half a Pit tier better but is more difficult to play, and your mileage may vary with this setup.

Of the available options, a 2-handed Polearm provides the most consistently applicable bonus (except for Pit Pushing; then, use a 1-handed Dagger to fit in more high value Aspects). The build works really well when you decimate everything in seconds, but may get overwhelmed if fights are long against high level monsters.

This amplifies the multiplier from considerably, so it's worthwhile to maintain the Spikes underneath your priority target. Bosses are immune to Crowd Control (CC) effects and instead take Stagger Damage when hit by one. The amount of stagger damage dealt depends on the type of CC and is proportional to its duration.

This is the final version of the build's progression, including all regular , leaving you with a great all-rounder build for all content in the game. Additional variants use this as a baseline to optimize around certain activities. This Speedfarming variant optimizes the build for easy activities like Tiers after you have finished the variant and reached a plateau in your progression. This setup optimizes the build to push the highest possible Tiers in after you have finished the variant and reached a plateau in your progression. The Pit Push setup varies considerably from the rest of the guide. At a high level, instead of dealing damage in a larger area with , it focuses on manually casting (at a slower rate and in a smaller area) while leveraging Overpower, something that unfortunately can't do. The Grizzly Rage variant also misses out on mobility, relegating it to Pit Push scenarios. The Pit Push variant uses the Key Passive to bolster Overpower damage and to accelerate its proc rate. Whereas deal most of your damage in the setup, this variant drops completely in favor of additional multipliers from There is a variant for this variant that performs approximately half a Pit tier better but is more difficult to play, and your mileage may vary with this setup. Rather than relying on to pull, you can go for for periodic bursts of damage. For grouping, use . The expected result of these swaps is a slower clear, as pulls less frequently and is noticeably worse at applying your , but higher overall damage that is most apparent with faster Boss kills. Once a guide is released, many players have questions on why and how we are approaching certain choices. In this section you can find the answers to the questions that have been asked the most. You need to use a 2-hander, as the damage multiplier from is absurdly high. Of the available options, a 2-handed Polearm provides the most consistently applicable bonus (except for Pit Pushing; then, use a 1-handed Dagger to fit in more high value Aspects). The build works really well when you decimate everything in seconds, but may get overwhelmed if fights are long against high level monsters. There are several adjustments you can make when you have trouble with more difficult content: Druids have only two non-Ultimate sources of . If you're not subscribed to either, is a great alternative to those skills. Generally hardcore and softcore share the same builds. Outside of being more prudent in your gameplay, you can also tweak the setup slightly to raise your survivability: Aside from having an excellent suite of stats that benefit , the created Tectonic Spikes allow us to generate even more Pillars when we cast either within their range. This amplifies the multiplier from considerably, so it's worthwhile to maintain the Spikes underneath your priority target. Bosses are immune to Crowd Control (CC) effects and instead take Stagger Damage when hit by one. The amount of stagger damage dealt depends on the type of CC and is proportional to its duration. After being hit by a CC effect, the Boss will temporarily take less Stagger Damage from a CC of the same type. Effectively, this means that when you're just spamming one type of CC you don't need to spam any more of it than what you need to keep a normal enemy permanently CC-d. To stagger the Boss quickly you need to use as many different types of CC as possible. After the Boss is staggered it gains a certain amount of stacking Stagger Damage Reduction for the rest of the fight: Bosses naturally regain 1% of their Stagger HP every second and when that regen is combined with 90% Stagger Damage Reduction it becomes borderline impossible to Stagger the Boss again unless you bring a serious amount of crowd controls. The Landslide Druid is an AoE powerhouse with significant Speedfarming and Pit Pushing potential. Its tanky enough to stand in the middle of the fight and continue dishing out damage. Shapeshifting and Poison multipliers are incorporated thanks to , respectively, pushing the damage profile even further. Reviewed by"

This Speedfarming variant optimizes the build for easy activities like Tiers after you have finished the variant and reached a plateau in your progression. This setup optimizes the build to push the highest possible Tiers in after you have finished the variant and reached a plateau in your progression. The Pit Push setup varies considerably from the rest of the guide. At a high level, instead of dealing damage in a larger area with , it focuses on manually casting (at a slower rate and in a smaller area) while leveraging Overpower, something that unfortunately can't do. The Grizzly Rage variant also misses out on mobility, relegating it to Pit Push scenarios. The Pit Push variant uses the Key Passive to bolster Overpower damage and to accelerate its proc rate. Whereas deal most of your damage in the setup, this variant drops completely in favor of additional multipliers from There is a variant for this variant that performs approximately half a Pit tier better but is more difficult to play, and your mileage may vary with this setup. Rather than relying on to pull, you can go for for periodic bursts of damage. For grouping, use . The expected result of these swaps is a slower clear, as pulls less frequently and is noticeably worse at applying your , but higher overall damage that is most apparent with faster Boss kills. Once a guide is released, many players have questions on why and how we are approaching certain choices. In this section you can find the answers to the questions that have been asked the most. You need to use a 2-hander, as the damage multiplier from is absurdly high. Of the available options, a 2-handed Polearm provides the most consistently applicable bonus (except for Pit Pushing; then, use a 1-handed Dagger to fit in more high value Aspects). The build works really well when you decimate everything in seconds, but may get overwhelmed if fights are long against high level monsters.

This amplifies the multiplier from considerably, so it's worthwhile to maintain the Spikes underneath your priority target. Bosses are immune to Crowd Control (CC) effects and instead take Stagger Damage when hit by one. The amount of stagger damage dealt depends on the type of CC and is proportional to its duration. After being hit by a CC effect, the Boss will temporarily take less Stagger Damage from a CC of the same type. Effectively, this means that when you're just spamming one type of CC you don't need to spam any more of it than what you need to keep a normal enemy permanently CC-d. To stagger the Boss quickly you need to use as many different types of CC as possible. After the Boss is staggered it gains a certain amount of stacking Stagger Damage Reduction for the rest of the fight: Bosses naturally regain 1% of their Stagger HP every second and when that regen is combined with 90% Stagger Damage Reduction it becomes borderline impossible to Stagger the Boss again unless you bring a serious amount of crowd controls. The Landslide Druid is an AoE powerhouse with significant Speedfarming and Pit Pushing potential. Its tanky enough to stand in the middle of the fight and continue dishing out damage. Shapeshifting and Poison multipliers are incorporated thanks to , respectively, pushing the damage profile even further. Reviewed by"

Effectively, this means that when you're just spamming one type of CC you don't need to spam any more of it than what you need to keep a normal enemy permanently CC-d. To stagger the Boss quickly you need to use as many different types of CC as possible. After the Boss is staggered it gains a certain amount of stacking Stagger Damage Reduction for the rest of the fight: Bosses naturally regain 1% of their Stagger HP every second and when that regen is combined with 90% Stagger Damage Reduction it becomes borderline impossible to Stagger the Boss again unless you bring a serious amount of crowd controls.

This is the final version of the build's progression, including all regular , leaving you with a great all-rounder build for all content in the game. Additional variants use this as a baseline to optimize around certain activities. This Speedfarming variant optimizes the build for easy activities like Tiers after you have finished the variant and reached a plateau in your progression. This setup optimizes the build to push the highest possible Tiers in after you have finished the variant and reached a plateau in your progression. The Pit Push setup varies considerably from the rest of the guide. At a high level, instead of dealing damage in a larger area with , it focuses on manually casting (at a slower rate and in a smaller area) while leveraging Overpower, something that unfortunately can't do. The Grizzly Rage variant also misses out on mobility, relegating it to Pit Push scenarios. The Pit Push variant uses the Key Passive to bolster Overpower damage and to accelerate its proc rate.
