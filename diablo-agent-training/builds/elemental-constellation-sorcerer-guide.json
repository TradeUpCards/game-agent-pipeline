With the right setup this tiny little elemental dagger firing off every 3 seconds with a light fart noise can deal absolutely insane amounts of damage. Unfortunately the build doesn't do much damage without these daggers so it tends to do poorly in speedfarming content due to small AoE, random targeting, and low rate of fire. is the key item for any version of this build because it fixes both random targeting and small AoE issues of . Without it, this aspect can only serve as a little bit of supplementary damage against bosses and such. Raiment also highly incentivizes us to use which makes this build somewhat palatable in speedfarming. There's a lot of different ways to stack . In this guide we focus on two of them. Starter setup uses . Combined with Double Fire Bolt Projectiles temper, this item casts 6 extra every time you cast one. The advantage of this setup is that it doesn't require anything else to get it running just one (with any roll) and 1 weapon temper. In the lategame we transition to a more powerful hybrid setup which uses Rune to feed two daggers at once. Season 6 is the . It features the faction which hunts Realmwalkers, massive behemoths that roam outdoor zones and beckon Mephisto's hellspawn. Participate in these zone events and take down the Realmwalkers to spawn a portal to a Seething Realm. There you can acquire Seething Opals, new consumables that stack with Elixirs for a XP buff and the chance to gather extra rewards when defeating enemies. The types of Opals are: Use these Opals at all times to earn reputation with the faction and unlock further rewards. Sorcerers can choose two skills to put into Enchantment Slots, where they provide powerful passive bonuses. Elemental Constellation Sorcerer uses the following Enchantments: Use the slider to see the progression steps. At around Paragon 200, leveling slows down significantly and all important nodes and Glyph sockets should be unlocked. Afterwards, you can min/max your build with minor tweaks and by picking up additional smaller nodes. Some Glyph position swaps, board changes and other pathing adjustments may occur as you unlock your full potential. The setup displayed by default is the final version of the build before spending additional points that do not significantly impact your character's power. *If you're still on version of the build by the time you reach 4th board, use (don't level them past 15) You can have up to two Runewords in your setup, each consisting of one Rune. Socket them in Two-Handed Weapons if your build calls for them, otherwise place them into your Armor pieces to replace normal gems. The Elemental Constellation Sorcerer focuses on the following combos: If you haven't unlocked the final setup or found the top runes, you can also benefit from these options: are unlocked during the Vessel of Hatred campaign and assist you in battle. There are 4 separate Mercenaries to choose from, each with their own skill trees and abilities. You can have one (permanent) mercenary during solo play and a who assists you from time to time in certain situations. Subo passively gives us a maphack which is so nice to play with it's hard to use any other merc after trying it once. On top of that he provides some extra damage through with Injured trigger for its massive damage reduction which can save our life in sticky situations. To enable the Elemental Constellation Sorcerer to perform optimally, hunt for these stats on your gear with good rolls and aim to them accordingly. Keep in mind that certain stats, such as Armor, Resistances, Extra Size Tempers, Attack Speed and more, have caps that may affect your priorities according to the items and Paragon points available at that moment. Before you dive into the Endgame with the Elemental Constellation Sorcerer, take a look at this overview of the items used in the build. See below for further details about the different progression steps and variants. Some of your Skill Tree choices depend on what items are available to you. Keep in mind that while we can guarantee that everyone has access to the same Aspects, the exact progression is different for everyone. This section is designed to guide your Elemental Constellation Sorcerer from a fresh level 60 into the very late endgame using the three variants . At the final step, you should be fully decked out with a great all-rounder build. From there, follow the other min/max variants if you want to optimize around certain activities such as If you are fresh in Torment 1 coming from a leveling guide, this is where you begin. Since only some Aspects can be guaranteed from Dungeon unlocks for the , focus on acquiring the additional aspects via gambling with The goal here is to progress through the Torment difficulties as you unlock Ancestrals, Paragon points, all and the most important to pilot this build. Some are used temporarily to fill slots that may be replaced with more items later on. This is the final version of the build's progression, including all regular , leaving you with a great all-rounder build for all content in the game. Additional variants use this as a baseline to optimize around certain activities. This Speedfarming variant optimizes the build for easy activities like Tiers after you have finished the variant and reached a plateau in your progression. is a mandatory item for any serious Sorcerer speedfarming build. What makes this item so good is not the stats on it and not even the unique power but the implicit roll that makes your attacks reduce Evade cooldown by 2.5 seconds, which is 1 second more than what you can normally have on Boots. However, that 1 second makes all the difference. With enough CDR, we can reach a point where we can after every attack! To get to that point of infinite teleports we need: However, even with all this speed, Elemental Constellation Sorcerer is not great for speedfarming. Since we deal all damage with elemental daggers we have to wait 1-2 seconds on every pack of mobs so it goes quite slowly even if we oneshot everything. Luckily this problem can be easily resolved: by replacing (which goes on the Amulet in speed build) with and changing our runes to we get an almost exact copy of , which is amazing for anything speed-related. This setup optimizes the build to push the highest possible Tiers in after you have finished the variant and reached a plateau in your progression. Once a guide is released, many players have questions on why and how we are approaching certain choices. In this section you can find the answers to the questions that have been asked the most. The build works really well when you decimate everything in seconds, but may get overwhelmed if fights are long against high level monsters. There are several adjustments you can make when you have trouble with more difficult content: This build has 3 major Mana sources: , Lucky Hit Chance to Restore, and . Apart from simply getting better items that give you more of the former two you can slightly improve their efficiency by different means such as: seems like a good item on paper: it doubles the amount of spells we cast going from 2 (1 base + 1 from ) to 4 with 2 exra Basic spells. On top of it it has a very high Attack Speed roll that goes into second Attack Speed cap which easily compensates all the stats we're missing by not running a normal Staff. However, missing an Aspect slot on a two-handed weapon makes us lose about 51% damage so we barely come out ahead. On top of that not all our stacks are created by the spells we directly cast. Some come from our enchantments, some come from multi-elemental nature of and a bunch more come from increases our stack generation by about 50% and that is not worth all the damage multipliers we are losing. Elemental Constellation Sorcerer is an extremely powerful but somewhat slow and clumsy build that excels at creating REALLY BIG numbers."

What makes this item so good is not the stats on it and not even the unique power but the implicit roll that makes your attacks reduce Evade cooldown by 2.5 seconds, which is 1 second more than what you can normally have on Boots. However, that 1 second makes all the difference. With enough CDR, we can reach a point where we can after every attack! To get to that point of infinite teleports we need: However, even with all this speed, Elemental Constellation Sorcerer is not great for speedfarming. Since we deal all damage with elemental daggers we have to wait 1-2 seconds on every pack of mobs so it goes quite slowly even if we oneshot everything. Luckily this problem can be easily resolved: by replacing (which goes on the Amulet in speed build) with and changing our runes to we get an almost exact copy of , which is amazing for anything speed-related. This setup optimizes the build to push the highest possible Tiers in after you have finished the variant and reached a plateau in your progression.

On top of it it has a very high Attack Speed roll that goes into second Attack Speed cap which easily compensates all the stats we're missing by not running a normal Staff. However, missing an Aspect slot on a two-handed weapon makes us lose about 51% damage so we barely come out ahead. On top of that not all our stacks are created by the spells we directly cast. Some come from our enchantments, some come from multi-elemental nature of and a bunch more come from increases our stack generation by about 50% and that is not worth all the damage multipliers we are losing. Elemental Constellation Sorcerer is an extremely powerful but somewhat slow and clumsy build that excels at creating REALLY BIG numbers."

This Speedfarming variant optimizes the build for easy activities like Tiers after you have finished the variant and reached a plateau in your progression. is a mandatory item for any serious Sorcerer speedfarming build. What makes this item so good is not the stats on it and not even the unique power but the implicit roll that makes your attacks reduce Evade cooldown by 2.5 seconds, which is 1 second more than what you can normally have on Boots. However, that 1 second makes all the difference. With enough CDR, we can reach a point where we can after every attack! To get to that point of infinite teleports we need: However, even with all this speed, Elemental Constellation Sorcerer is not great for speedfarming. Since we deal all damage with elemental daggers we have to wait 1-2 seconds on every pack of mobs so it goes quite slowly even if we oneshot everything. Luckily this problem can be easily resolved: by replacing (which goes on the Amulet in speed build) with and changing our runes to we get an almost exact copy of , which is amazing for anything speed-related.

On top of it it has a very high Attack Speed roll that goes into second Attack Speed cap which easily compensates all the stats we're missing by not running a normal Staff. However, missing an Aspect slot on a two-handed weapon makes us lose about 51% damage so we barely come out ahead. On top of that not all our stacks are created by the spells we directly cast. Some come from our enchantments, some come from multi-elemental nature of and a bunch more come from increases our stack generation by about 50% and that is not worth all the damage multipliers we are losing.

Keep in mind that while we can guarantee that everyone has access to the same Aspects, the exact progression is different for everyone. This section is designed to guide your Elemental Constellation Sorcerer from a fresh level 60 into the very late endgame using the three variants . At the final step, you should be fully decked out with a great all-rounder build. From there, follow the other min/max variants if you want to optimize around certain activities such as If you are fresh in Torment 1 coming from a leveling guide, this is where you begin. Since only some Aspects can be guaranteed from Dungeon unlocks for the , focus on acquiring the additional aspects via gambling with The goal here is to progress through the Torment difficulties as you unlock Ancestrals, Paragon points, all and the most important to pilot this build. Some are used temporarily to fill slots that may be replaced with more items later on. This is the final version of the build's progression, including all regular , leaving you with a great all-rounder build for all content in the game. Additional variants use this as a baseline to optimize around certain activities. This Speedfarming variant optimizes the build for easy activities like Tiers after you have finished the variant and reached a plateau in your progression. is a mandatory item for any serious Sorcerer speedfarming build. What makes this item so good is not the stats on it and not even the unique power but the implicit roll that makes your attacks reduce Evade cooldown by 2.5 seconds, which is 1 second more than what you can normally have on Boots. However, that 1 second makes all the difference. With enough CDR, we can reach a point where we can after every attack! To get to that point of infinite teleports we need: However, even with all this speed, Elemental Constellation Sorcerer is not great for speedfarming. Since we deal all damage with elemental daggers we have to wait 1-2 seconds on every pack of mobs so it goes quite slowly even if we oneshot everything. Luckily this problem can be easily resolved: by replacing (which goes on the Amulet in speed build) with and changing our runes to we get an almost exact copy of , which is amazing for anything speed-related. This setup optimizes the build to push the highest possible Tiers in after you have finished the variant and reached a plateau in your progression. Once a guide is released, many players have questions on why and how we are approaching certain choices. In this section you can find the answers to the questions that have been asked the most. The build works really well when you decimate everything in seconds, but may get overwhelmed if fights are long against high level monsters. There are several adjustments you can make when you have trouble with more difficult content: This build has 3 major Mana sources: , Lucky Hit Chance to Restore, and . Apart from simply getting better items that give you more of the former two you can slightly improve their efficiency by different means such as: seems like a good item on paper: it doubles the amount of spells we cast going from 2 (1 base + 1 from ) to 4 with 2 exra Basic spells. On top of it it has a very high Attack Speed roll that goes into second Attack Speed cap which easily compensates all the stats we're missing by not running a normal Staff. However, missing an Aspect slot on a two-handed weapon makes us lose about 51% damage so we barely come out ahead. On top of that not all our stacks are created by the spells we directly cast. Some come from our enchantments, some come from multi-elemental nature of and a bunch more come from increases our stack generation by about 50% and that is not worth all the damage multipliers we are losing. Elemental Constellation Sorcerer is an extremely powerful but somewhat slow and clumsy build that excels at creating REALLY BIG numbers."
