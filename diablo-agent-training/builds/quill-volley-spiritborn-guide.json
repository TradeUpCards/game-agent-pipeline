Our main skill, , fires several feathers than fan out and can shotgun enemies at close range, creating a superb mix of AoE and single target damage. While the build relies on Eagle skills to deal damage, we choose primary and secondary in our Spirit Hall to benefit from extra barriers and damage passives. Together with we gain a massive damage bonus by combining these different spirits in the same setup. This build doesn't need much to get started besides one Dungeon Codex Power, but Spiritborn has access to many strong aspects that amplify this build. The primary objective is creating an infinite resource engine as soon as possible to spam while triggering every attack. This can be achieved with ) and sources of Resource Generation, supercharging the build in the lategame. Early on, we start with and multiple ability-based sources and then transition to once the above setup comes online. All in all, the Eagle Spiritborn is an amazing allrounder that progresses through the Torment difficulties easily and can deal with anything the game throws at you. Let's get started!

At around Paragon 200, leveling slows down significantly and all important nodes and Glyph sockets should be unlocked. Afterwards, you can min/max your build with minor tweaks and by picking up additional smaller nodes. Some Glyph position swaps, board changes and other pathing adjustments may occur as you unlock your full potential. The setup displayed by default is the final version of the build before spending additional points that do not significantly impact your character's power. You can have up to two Runewords in your setup, each consisting of one Rune. Socket them in Two-Handed Weapons if your build calls for them, otherwise place them into your Armor pieces to replace normal gems. The Quill Volley Spiritborn focuses on the following combos: As long as you haven't unlocked the final setup or found the top Runes, you can also benefit from these options: are unlocked during the Vessel of Hatred campaign and assist you in battle. There are 4 separate Mercenaries to choose from, each with their own skill trees and abilities. You can have one (permanent) mercenary during solo play and a who assists you from time to time in certain situations. He provides us with extra All Resistances, regularly applies an extra damage buff through and prevents us from getting oneshot every 30 seconds thanks to . Beware that he's not present when playing in groups, so make sure you remain resistance capped without him. for extra damage reduction which preferably happens exactly when we cast To enable the Quill Volley Spiritborn to perform optimally, hunt for these stats on your gear with good rolls and aim to them accordingly. The indicates which affix is most impactful to , and it does not indicate how many you need on that particular affix. Keep in mind that certain stats, such as Armor, Resistances, Extra Size Tempers, Attack Speed, and more, have caps that may affect your priorities according to the items and Paragon points available at that moment. * This means 65% from 13 stacks of and 98.80% from gear, Paragon, . Alternatively use to cap out your Armor or Attack Speed if necessary. It is critical that fully restores your Vigor every time you hit. If it doesn't you won't do any damage. You will need at least 100% resource generation with a perfect 50% roll on . Here are a few data points showing roll and the required Resource generation to fully restore Vigor: This means that a good affix on is required to have a chance of making the combo with work. Resource Generation stacks multiplicatively with each source. In this build sources are: Intelligence, , Paragon nodes on the board. This leaves you with and/or Resource Generation tempers on jewelry to finish the rest. With good endgame gear, one of these is enough, but before that you may need to add extra tempers and masterwork crits ranks to achieve this result. Stacking more Resource Generation after you have reached the critical point no longer provides any benefit, and if you are overshooting, you instead want to go with Resource Cost Reduction (tempers on Rings), which increases the damage done by consumption effect. Learn more about this interaction in the Before you dive into the Endgame with the Quill Volley Spiritborn, take a look at this overview of the items used in the build. See below for further details about the different progression steps and variants. Some of your Skill Tree choices depend on what items are available to you. Keep in mind that while we can guarantee that everyone has access to the same Aspects, the exact progression is different for everyone. This section is designed to guide your Quill Volley Spiritborn from a fresh level 60 into the very late endgame using the three variants . At the final step, you should be fully decked out with a great all-rounder build. From there, follow the other min/max variants if you want to optimize around certain activities such as If you are fresh in Torment 1 coming from a leveling guide, this is where you begin. Since only some Aspects can be guaranteed from Dungeon unlocks for the , focus on acquiring the additional aspects via gambling with The goal here is to progress through the Torment difficulties as you unlock Ancestrals, Paragon points, all and the most important to pilot this build. Some are used temporarily to fill slots that may be replaced with more items later on. This is the final version of the build's progression, including all regular , leaving you with a great all-rounder build for all content in the game. Additional variants use this as a baseline to optimize around certain activities. This Speedfarming variant optimizes the build for easy activities like Tiers after you have finished the variant and reached a plateau in your progression. This setup optimizes the build to push the highest possible Tiers in after you have finished the variant and reached a plateau in your progression. There are various double-dipping bugs that allow main hall to benefit from damage buffs to the original hit and again for its damage proc. Beware that this build or variants of it include some choices leaning into this interaction, which could be fixed at any moment leading to guide adjustments and a loss of power. However, we believe that a fix to these bugs is very unlikely during Season 9. Known double-dipping interactions occur with the following: since we no longer apply thorns damage reliably and redistribute a few points in various places. This is an alternative lategame setup if you want to try something different, based on stacking up and detonating them with . Thanks to the poison novas from the helm and passive, this build has incredible AoE damage scaling to the moon in large monster packs, but falls off against high tier single target bosses. However, it's still a relatively competent build that can farm and push at acceptable levels. The playstyle and skill setup remain largely the same compared to typical builds, but the Core Skill no longer deals any significant damage. Instead, we focus purely on procs to scale their damage output. There are various double-dipping bugs that allow main hall to benefit from damage buffs to the original hit and again for its damage proc. Beware that this build or variants of it include some choices leaning into this interaction, which could be fixed at any moment leading to guide adjustments and a loss of power. However, we believe that a fix to these bugs is very unlikely during Season 9. Known double-dipping interactions occur with the following: Once a guide is released, many players have questions on why and how we are approaching certain choices. In this section you can find the answers to the questions that have been asked the most. The build works really well when you decimate everything in seconds, but may get overwhelmed if fights are long against high level monsters. There are several adjustments you can make when you have trouble with more difficult content: If there are times when your isn't doing damage it is most likely because you don't fully restore all Vigor between every hit with spends all of your resource to significantly increase the damage of , add two extra feathers and guaranteed a crit. If that doesn't happen at all, you must invest more into resource generation (e.g. tempers, masterworking on jewelry) or get a better ring. It may also be that you only reach the threshold needed when Measured Ravager is active and your uptime is too low in boss encounters. This build has multiple major progression steps related to your resource generation. Make sure to use at least one of the following: Generally hardcore and softcore share the same builds. Outside of being more prudent in your gameplay, you can also tweak the setup slightly to raise your survivability: The most important stat on is the Vigor restore percent! restores 20 - 50% of the Vigor spent in the last two seconds. The ring tracks how much is spent on your buff bar and consumes the buff on your next crit, so you can't scale its effect by attacking quickly. The higher the roll the easier it will be to reach enough resource generation to fully restore your Vigor each attack. If you don't have enough resource generation you will do no damage! To find out how much resource generation your roll needs to fully restore your Vigor follow this formula: Here is a table showing roll and the required Resource generation to fully restore Vigor: When calculating resource generation it is important to remember resource generation is multiplicative. Here is the formula for calculating resource generation: Resource generation = ((100% + Source 1) x (100% + Source 2) x (100% + Source 3) …) - 100% I strongly suggest aiming for a \"chance to hit twice\": \"cast at maximum size\": Resource Cost Reduction: Barrier Generation works with: Barrier Generation doesn't work with: Read up more on Attack Speed in our Bosses are immune to Crowd Control (CC) effects and instead take Stagger Damage when hit by one. The amount of stagger damage dealt depends on the type of CC and is proportional to its duration. After being hit by a CC effect, the Boss will temporarily take less Stagger Damage from a CC of the same type. Effectively, this means that when you're just spamming one type of CC you don't need to spam any more of it than what you need to keep a normal enemy permanently CC-d. To stagger the Boss quickly you need to use as many different types of CC as possible. After the Boss is staggered it gains a certain amount of stacking Stagger Damage Reduction for the rest of the fight: Bosses naturally regain 1% of their Stagger HP every second and when that regen is combined with 90% Stagger Damage Reduction it becomes borderline impossible to Stagger the Boss again unless you bring a serious amount of crowd controls. The Quill Volley Spiritborn is a highly mobile allrounder that combines great AoE clear and single target damage."

The indicates which affix is most impactful to , and it does not indicate how many you need on that particular affix. Keep in mind that certain stats, such as Armor, Resistances, Extra Size Tempers, Attack Speed, and more, have caps that may affect your priorities according to the items and Paragon points available at that moment. * This means 65% from 13 stacks of and 98.80% from gear, Paragon, . Alternatively use to cap out your Armor or Attack Speed if necessary. It is critical that fully restores your Vigor every time you hit. If it doesn't you won't do any damage. You will need at least 100% resource generation with a perfect 50% roll on . Here are a few data points showing roll and the required Resource generation to fully restore Vigor: This means that a good affix on is required to have a chance of making the combo with work. Resource Generation stacks multiplicatively with each source. In this build sources are: Intelligence, , Paragon nodes on the board. This leaves you with and/or Resource Generation tempers on jewelry to finish the rest. With good endgame gear, one of these is enough, but before that you may need to add extra tempers and masterwork crits ranks to achieve this result. Stacking more Resource Generation after you have reached the critical point no longer provides any benefit, and if you are overshooting, you instead want to go with Resource Cost Reduction (tempers on Rings), which increases the damage done by consumption effect. Learn more about this interaction in the Before you dive into the Endgame with the Quill Volley Spiritborn, take a look at this overview of the items used in the build. See below for further details about the different progression steps and variants. Some of your Skill Tree choices depend on what items are available to you. Keep in mind that while we can guarantee that everyone has access to the same Aspects, the exact progression is different for everyone. This section is designed to guide your Quill Volley Spiritborn from a fresh level 60 into the very late endgame using the three variants . At the final step, you should be fully decked out with a great all-rounder build. From there, follow the other min/max variants if you want to optimize around certain activities such as If you are fresh in Torment 1 coming from a leveling guide, this is where you begin. Since only some Aspects can be guaranteed from Dungeon unlocks for the , focus on acquiring the additional aspects via gambling with The goal here is to progress through the Torment difficulties as you unlock Ancestrals, Paragon points, all and the most important to pilot this build. Some are used temporarily to fill slots that may be replaced with more items later on. This is the final version of the build's progression, including all regular , leaving you with a great all-rounder build for all content in the game. Additional variants use this as a baseline to optimize around certain activities. This Speedfarming variant optimizes the build for easy activities like Tiers after you have finished the variant and reached a plateau in your progression. This setup optimizes the build to push the highest possible Tiers in after you have finished the variant and reached a plateau in your progression. There are various double-dipping bugs that allow main hall to benefit from damage buffs to the original hit and again for its damage proc. Beware that this build or variants of it include some choices leaning into this interaction, which could be fixed at any moment leading to guide adjustments and a loss of power. However, we believe that a fix to these bugs is very unlikely during Season 9. Known double-dipping interactions occur with the following: since we no longer apply thorns damage reliably and redistribute a few points in various places. This is an alternative lategame setup if you want to try something different, based on stacking up and detonating them with . Thanks to the poison novas from the helm and passive, this build has incredible AoE damage scaling to the moon in large monster packs, but falls off against high tier single target bosses. However, it's still a relatively competent build that can farm and push at acceptable levels. The playstyle and skill setup remain largely the same compared to typical builds, but the Core Skill no longer deals any significant damage. Instead, we focus purely on procs to scale their damage output.

However, we believe that a fix to these bugs is very unlikely during Season 9. Known double-dipping interactions occur with the following: Once a guide is released, many players have questions on why and how we are approaching certain choices. In this section you can find the answers to the questions that have been asked the most. The build works really well when you decimate everything in seconds, but may get overwhelmed if fights are long against high level monsters. There are several adjustments you can make when you have trouble with more difficult content: If there are times when your isn't doing damage it is most likely because you don't fully restore all Vigor between every hit with spends all of your resource to significantly increase the damage of , add two extra feathers and guaranteed a crit. If that doesn't happen at all, you must invest more into resource generation (e.g. tempers, masterworking on jewelry) or get a better ring. It may also be that you only reach the threshold needed when Measured Ravager is active and your uptime is too low in boss encounters. This build has multiple major progression steps related to your resource generation. Make sure to use at least one of the following: Generally hardcore and softcore share the same builds. Outside of being more prudent in your gameplay, you can also tweak the setup slightly to raise your survivability: The most important stat on is the Vigor restore percent! restores 20 - 50% of the Vigor spent in the last two seconds. The ring tracks how much is spent on your buff bar and consumes the buff on your next crit, so you can't scale its effect by attacking quickly. The higher the roll the easier it will be to reach enough resource generation to fully restore your Vigor each attack. If you don't have enough resource generation you will do no damage! To find out how much resource generation your roll needs to fully restore your Vigor follow this formula: Here is a table showing roll and the required Resource generation to fully restore Vigor: When calculating resource generation it is important to remember resource generation is multiplicative. Here is the formula for calculating resource generation: Resource generation = ((100% + Source 1) x (100% + Source 2) x (100% + Source 3) …) - 100% I strongly suggest aiming for a \"chance to hit twice\": \"cast at maximum size\": Resource Cost Reduction: Barrier Generation works with: Barrier Generation doesn't work with: Read up more on Attack Speed in our Bosses are immune to Crowd Control (CC) effects and instead take Stagger Damage when hit by one. The amount of stagger damage dealt depends on the type of CC and is proportional to its duration. After being hit by a CC effect, the Boss will temporarily take less Stagger Damage from a CC of the same type. Effectively, this means that when you're just spamming one type of CC you don't need to spam any more of it than what you need to keep a normal enemy permanently CC-d. To stagger the Boss quickly you need to use as many different types of CC as possible. After the Boss is staggered it gains a certain amount of stacking Stagger Damage Reduction for the rest of the fight: Bosses naturally regain 1% of their Stagger HP every second and when that regen is combined with 90% Stagger Damage Reduction it becomes borderline impossible to Stagger the Boss again unless you bring a serious amount of crowd controls. The Quill Volley Spiritborn is a highly mobile allrounder that combines great AoE clear and single target damage."

At around Paragon 200, leveling slows down significantly and all important nodes and Glyph sockets should be unlocked. Afterwards, you can min/max your build with minor tweaks and by picking up additional smaller nodes. Some Glyph position swaps, board changes and other pathing adjustments may occur as you unlock your full potential. The setup displayed by default is the final version of the build before spending additional points that do not significantly impact your character's power. You can have up to two Runewords in your setup, each consisting of one Rune. Socket them in Two-Handed Weapons if your build calls for them, otherwise place them into your Armor pieces to replace normal gems. The Quill Volley Spiritborn focuses on the following combos: As long as you haven't unlocked the final setup or found the top Runes, you can also benefit from these options: are unlocked during the Vessel of Hatred campaign and assist you in battle. There are 4 separate Mercenaries to choose from, each with their own skill trees and abilities. You can have one (permanent) mercenary during solo play and a who assists you from time to time in certain situations.

The indicates which affix is most impactful to , and it does not indicate how many you need on that particular affix. Keep in mind that certain stats, such as Armor, Resistances, Extra Size Tempers, Attack Speed, and more, have caps that may affect your priorities according to the items and Paragon points available at that moment. * This means 65% from 13 stacks of and 98.80% from gear, Paragon, . Alternatively use to cap out your Armor or Attack Speed if necessary. It is critical that fully restores your Vigor every time you hit. If it doesn't you won't do any damage. You will need at least 100% resource generation with a perfect 50% roll on . Here are a few data points showing roll and the required Resource generation to fully restore Vigor: This means that a good affix on is required to have a chance of making the combo with work. Resource Generation stacks multiplicatively with each source. In this build sources are: Intelligence, , Paragon nodes on the board. This leaves you with and/or Resource Generation tempers on jewelry to finish the rest. With good endgame gear, one of these is enough, but before that you may need to add extra tempers and masterwork crits ranks to achieve this result. Stacking more Resource Generation after you have reached the critical point no longer provides any benefit, and if you are overshooting, you instead want to go with Resource Cost Reduction (tempers on Rings), which increases the damage done by consumption effect. Learn more about this interaction in the Before you dive into the Endgame with the Quill Volley Spiritborn, take a look at this overview of the items used in the build. See below for further details about the different progression steps and variants. Some of your Skill Tree choices depend on what items are available to you. Keep in mind that while we can guarantee that everyone has access to the same Aspects, the exact progression is different for everyone. This section is designed to guide your Quill Volley Spiritborn from a fresh level 60 into the very late endgame using the three variants . At the final step, you should be fully decked out with a great all-rounder build. From there, follow the other min/max variants if you want to optimize around certain activities such as If you are fresh in Torment 1 coming from a leveling guide, this is where you begin. Since only some Aspects can be guaranteed from Dungeon unlocks for the , focus on acquiring the additional aspects via gambling with The goal here is to progress through the Torment difficulties as you unlock Ancestrals, Paragon points, all and the most important to pilot this build. Some are used temporarily to fill slots that may be replaced with more items later on. This is the final version of the build's progression, including all regular , leaving you with a great all-rounder build for all content in the game. Additional variants use this as a baseline to optimize around certain activities. This Speedfarming variant optimizes the build for easy activities like Tiers after you have finished the variant and reached a plateau in your progression. This setup optimizes the build to push the highest possible Tiers in after you have finished the variant and reached a plateau in your progression. There are various double-dipping bugs that allow main hall to benefit from damage buffs to the original hit and again for its damage proc. Beware that this build or variants of it include some choices leaning into this interaction, which could be fixed at any moment leading to guide adjustments and a loss of power. However, we believe that a fix to these bugs is very unlikely during Season 9. Known double-dipping interactions occur with the following: since we no longer apply thorns damage reliably and redistribute a few points in various places. This is an alternative lategame setup if you want to try something different, based on stacking up and detonating them with . Thanks to the poison novas from the helm and passive, this build has incredible AoE damage scaling to the moon in large monster packs, but falls off against high tier single target bosses. However, it's still a relatively competent build that can farm and push at acceptable levels. The playstyle and skill setup remain largely the same compared to typical builds, but the Core Skill no longer deals any significant damage. Instead, we focus purely on procs to scale their damage output. There are various double-dipping bugs that allow main hall to benefit from damage buffs to the original hit and again for its damage proc. Beware that this build or variants of it include some choices leaning into this interaction, which could be fixed at any moment leading to guide adjustments and a loss of power. However, we believe that a fix to these bugs is very unlikely during Season 9. Known double-dipping interactions occur with the following: Once a guide is released, many players have questions on why and how we are approaching certain choices. In this section you can find the answers to the questions that have been asked the most. The build works really well when you decimate everything in seconds, but may get overwhelmed if fights are long against high level monsters. There are several adjustments you can make when you have trouble with more difficult content: If there are times when your isn't doing damage it is most likely because you don't fully restore all Vigor between every hit with spends all of your resource to significantly increase the damage of , add two extra feathers and guaranteed a crit. If that doesn't happen at all, you must invest more into resource generation (e.g. tempers, masterworking on jewelry) or get a better ring. It may also be that you only reach the threshold needed when Measured Ravager is active and your uptime is too low in boss encounters. This build has multiple major progression steps related to your resource generation. Make sure to use at least one of the following: Generally hardcore and softcore share the same builds. Outside of being more prudent in your gameplay, you can also tweak the setup slightly to raise your survivability: The most important stat on is the Vigor restore percent! restores 20 - 50% of the Vigor spent in the last two seconds. The ring tracks how much is spent on your buff bar and consumes the buff on your next crit, so you can't scale its effect by attacking quickly. The higher the roll the easier it will be to reach enough resource generation to fully restore your Vigor each attack. If you don't have enough resource generation you will do no damage! To find out how much resource generation your roll needs to fully restore your Vigor follow this formula: Here is a table showing roll and the required Resource generation to fully restore Vigor: When calculating resource generation it is important to remember resource generation is multiplicative. Here is the formula for calculating resource generation: Resource generation = ((100% + Source 1) x (100% + Source 2) x (100% + Source 3) …) - 100% I strongly suggest aiming for a \"chance to hit twice\": \"cast at maximum size\": Resource Cost Reduction: Barrier Generation works with: Barrier Generation doesn't work with: Read up more on Attack Speed in our Bosses are immune to Crowd Control (CC) effects and instead take Stagger Damage when hit by one. The amount of stagger damage dealt depends on the type of CC and is proportional to its duration. After being hit by a CC effect, the Boss will temporarily take less Stagger Damage from a CC of the same type. Effectively, this means that when you're just spamming one type of CC you don't need to spam any more of it than what you need to keep a normal enemy permanently CC-d. To stagger the Boss quickly you need to use as many different types of CC as possible. After the Boss is staggered it gains a certain amount of stacking Stagger Damage Reduction for the rest of the fight: Bosses naturally regain 1% of their Stagger HP every second and when that regen is combined with 90% Stagger Damage Reduction it becomes borderline impossible to Stagger the Boss again unless you bring a serious amount of crowd controls. The Quill Volley Spiritborn is a highly mobile allrounder that combines great AoE clear and single target damage."

From there, follow the other min/max variants if you want to optimize around certain activities such as If you are fresh in Torment 1 coming from a leveling guide, this is where you begin. Since only some Aspects can be guaranteed from Dungeon unlocks for the , focus on acquiring the additional aspects via gambling with The goal here is to progress through the Torment difficulties as you unlock Ancestrals, Paragon points, all and the most important to pilot this build. Some are used temporarily to fill slots that may be replaced with more items later on. This is the final version of the build's progression, including all regular , leaving you with a great all-rounder build for all content in the game. Additional variants use this as a baseline to optimize around certain activities. This Speedfarming variant optimizes the build for easy activities like Tiers after you have finished the variant and reached a plateau in your progression. This setup optimizes the build to push the highest possible Tiers in after you have finished the variant and reached a plateau in your progression. There are various double-dipping bugs that allow main hall to benefit from damage buffs to the original hit and again for its damage proc. Beware that this build or variants of it include some choices leaning into this interaction, which could be fixed at any moment leading to guide adjustments and a loss of power. However, we believe that a fix to these bugs is very unlikely during Season 9. Known double-dipping interactions occur with the following: since we no longer apply thorns damage reliably and redistribute a few points in various places. This is an alternative lategame setup if you want to try something different, based on stacking up and detonating them with . Thanks to the poison novas from the helm and passive, this build has incredible AoE damage scaling to the moon in large monster packs, but falls off against high tier single target bosses. However, it's still a relatively competent build that can farm and push at acceptable levels. The playstyle and skill setup remain largely the same compared to typical builds, but the Core Skill no longer deals any significant damage. Instead, we focus purely on procs to scale their damage output.

Beware that this build or variants of it include some choices leaning into this interaction, which could be fixed at any moment leading to guide adjustments and a loss of power. However, we believe that a fix to these bugs is very unlikely during Season 9. Known double-dipping interactions occur with the following: Once a guide is released, many players have questions on why and how we are approaching certain choices. In this section you can find the answers to the questions that have been asked the most. The build works really well when you decimate everything in seconds, but may get overwhelmed if fights are long against high level monsters. There are several adjustments you can make when you have trouble with more difficult content: If there are times when your isn't doing damage it is most likely because you don't fully restore all Vigor between every hit with spends all of your resource to significantly increase the damage of , add two extra feathers and guaranteed a crit. If that doesn't happen at all, you must invest more into resource generation (e.g. tempers, masterworking on jewelry) or get a better ring. It may also be that you only reach the threshold needed when Measured Ravager is active and your uptime is too low in boss encounters. This build has multiple major progression steps related to your resource generation. Make sure to use at least one of the following: Generally hardcore and softcore share the same builds. Outside of being more prudent in your gameplay, you can also tweak the setup slightly to raise your survivability: The most important stat on is the Vigor restore percent! restores 20 - 50% of the Vigor spent in the last two seconds. The ring tracks how much is spent on your buff bar and consumes the buff on your next crit, so you can't scale its effect by attacking quickly. The higher the roll the easier it will be to reach enough resource generation to fully restore your Vigor each attack. If you don't have enough resource generation you will do no damage! To find out how much resource generation your roll needs to fully restore your Vigor follow this formula: Here is a table showing roll and the required Resource generation to fully restore Vigor: When calculating resource generation it is important to remember resource generation is multiplicative. Here is the formula for calculating resource generation: Resource generation = ((100% + Source 1) x (100% + Source 2) x (100% + Source 3) …) - 100% I strongly suggest aiming for a \"chance to hit twice\": \"cast at maximum size\": Resource Cost Reduction: Barrier Generation works with: Barrier Generation doesn't work with: Read up more on Attack Speed in our Bosses are immune to Crowd Control (CC) effects and instead take Stagger Damage when hit by one. The amount of stagger damage dealt depends on the type of CC and is proportional to its duration. After being hit by a CC effect, the Boss will temporarily take less Stagger Damage from a CC of the same type. Effectively, this means that when you're just spamming one type of CC you don't need to spam any more of it than what you need to keep a normal enemy permanently CC-d. To stagger the Boss quickly you need to use as many different types of CC as possible. After the Boss is staggered it gains a certain amount of stacking Stagger Damage Reduction for the rest of the fight: Bosses naturally regain 1% of their Stagger HP every second and when that regen is combined with 90% Stagger Damage Reduction it becomes borderline impossible to Stagger the Boss again unless you bring a serious amount of crowd controls. The Quill Volley Spiritborn is a highly mobile allrounder that combines great AoE clear and single target damage."

You can have up to two Runewords in your setup, each consisting of one Rune.

There are 4 separate Mercenaries to choose from, each with their own skill trees and abilities. You can have one (permanent) mercenary during solo play and a who assists you from time to time in certain situations.

Resource Generation stacks multiplicatively with each source. In this build sources are: Intelligence, , Paragon nodes on the board. This leaves you with and/or Resource Generation tempers on jewelry to finish the rest. With good endgame gear, one of these is enough, but before that you may need to add extra tempers and masterwork crits ranks to achieve this result. Stacking more Resource Generation after you have reached the critical point no longer provides any benefit, and if you are overshooting, you instead want to go with Resource Cost Reduction (tempers on Rings), which increases the damage done by consumption effect.

Here is the formula for calculating resource generation: Resource generation = ((100% + Source 1) x (100% + Source 2) x (100% + Source 3) …) - 100% I strongly suggest aiming for a \"chance to hit twice\": \"cast at maximum size\": Resource Cost Reduction: Barrier Generation works with: Barrier Generation doesn't work with: Read up more on Attack Speed in our Bosses are immune to Crowd Control (CC) effects and instead take Stagger Damage when hit by one. The amount of stagger damage dealt depends on the type of CC and is proportional to its duration. After being hit by a CC effect, the Boss will temporarily take less Stagger Damage from a CC of the same type. Effectively, this means that when you're just spamming one type of CC you don't need to spam any more of it than what you need to keep a normal enemy permanently CC-d. To stagger the Boss quickly you need to use as many different types of CC as possible. After the Boss is staggered it gains a certain amount of stacking Stagger Damage Reduction for the rest of the fight: Bosses naturally regain 1% of their Stagger HP every second and when that regen is combined with 90% Stagger Damage Reduction it becomes borderline impossible to Stagger the Boss again unless you bring a serious amount of crowd controls. The Quill Volley Spiritborn is a highly mobile allrounder that combines great AoE clear and single target damage."

Stacking more Resource Generation after you have reached the critical point no longer provides any benefit, and if you are overshooting, you instead want to go with Resource Cost Reduction (tempers on Rings), which increases the damage done by consumption effect. Learn more about this interaction in the Before you dive into the Endgame with the Quill Volley Spiritborn, take a look at this overview of the items used in the build. See below for further details about the different progression steps and variants. Some of your Skill Tree choices depend on what items are available to you. Keep in mind that while we can guarantee that everyone has access to the same Aspects, the exact progression is different for everyone. This section is designed to guide your Quill Volley Spiritborn from a fresh level 60 into the very late endgame using the three variants . At the final step, you should be fully decked out with a great all-rounder build. From there, follow the other min/max variants if you want to optimize around certain activities such as If you are fresh in Torment 1 coming from a leveling guide, this is where you begin. Since only some Aspects can be guaranteed from Dungeon unlocks for the , focus on acquiring the additional aspects via gambling with The goal here is to progress through the Torment difficulties as you unlock Ancestrals, Paragon points, all and the most important to pilot this build.

This is the final version of the build's progression, including all regular , leaving you with a great all-rounder build for all content in the game. Additional variants use this as a baseline to optimize around certain activities. This Speedfarming variant optimizes the build for easy activities like Tiers after you have finished the variant and reached a plateau in your progression. This setup optimizes the build to push the highest possible Tiers in after you have finished the variant and reached a plateau in your progression. There are various double-dipping bugs that allow main hall to benefit from damage buffs to the original hit and again for its damage proc. Beware that this build or variants of it include some choices leaning into this interaction, which could be fixed at any moment leading to guide adjustments and a loss of power. However, we believe that a fix to these bugs is very unlikely during Season 9. Known double-dipping interactions occur with the following: since we no longer apply thorns damage reliably and redistribute a few points in various places. This is an alternative lategame setup if you want to try something different, based on stacking up and detonating them with . Thanks to the poison novas from the helm and passive, this build has incredible AoE damage scaling to the moon in large monster packs, but falls off against high tier single target bosses. However, it's still a relatively competent build that can farm and push at acceptable levels.

However, we believe that a fix to these bugs is very unlikely during Season 9. Known double-dipping interactions occur with the following: Once a guide is released, many players have questions on why and how we are approaching certain choices. In this section you can find the answers to the questions that have been asked the most. The build works really well when you decimate everything in seconds, but may get overwhelmed if fights are long against high level monsters. There are several adjustments you can make when you have trouble with more difficult content: If there are times when your isn't doing damage it is most likely because you don't fully restore all Vigor between every hit with spends all of your resource to significantly increase the damage of , add two extra feathers and guaranteed a crit. If that doesn't happen at all, you must invest more into resource generation (e.g. tempers, masterworking on jewelry) or get a better ring. It may also be that you only reach the threshold needed when Measured Ravager is active and your uptime is too low in boss encounters. This build has multiple major progression steps related to your resource generation. Make sure to use at least one of the following: Generally hardcore and softcore share the same builds. Outside of being more prudent in your gameplay, you can also tweak the setup slightly to raise your survivability: The most important stat on is the Vigor restore percent! restores 20 - 50% of the Vigor spent in the last two seconds. The ring tracks how much is spent on your buff bar and consumes the buff on your next crit, so you can't scale its effect by attacking quickly. The higher the roll the easier it will be to reach enough resource generation to fully restore your Vigor each attack. If you don't have enough resource generation you will do no damage! To find out how much resource generation your roll needs to fully restore your Vigor follow this formula: Here is a table showing roll and the required Resource generation to fully restore Vigor: When calculating resource generation it is important to remember resource generation is multiplicative. Here is the formula for calculating resource generation: Resource generation = ((100% + Source 1) x (100% + Source 2) x (100% + Source 3) …) - 100% I strongly suggest aiming for a \"chance to hit twice\": \"cast at maximum size\": Resource Cost Reduction: Barrier Generation works with: Barrier Generation doesn't work with: Read up more on Attack Speed in our Bosses are immune to Crowd Control (CC) effects and instead take Stagger Damage when hit by one. The amount of stagger damage dealt depends on the type of CC and is proportional to its duration. After being hit by a CC effect, the Boss will temporarily take less Stagger Damage from a CC of the same type. Effectively, this means that when you're just spamming one type of CC you don't need to spam any more of it than what you need to keep a normal enemy permanently CC-d. To stagger the Boss quickly you need to use as many different types of CC as possible. After the Boss is staggered it gains a certain amount of stacking Stagger Damage Reduction for the rest of the fight: Bosses naturally regain 1% of their Stagger HP every second and when that regen is combined with 90% Stagger Damage Reduction it becomes borderline impossible to Stagger the Boss again unless you bring a serious amount of crowd controls. The Quill Volley Spiritborn is a highly mobile allrounder that combines great AoE clear and single target damage."

Here is the formula for calculating resource generation: Resource generation = ((100% + Source 1) x (100% + Source 2) x (100% + Source 3) …) - 100% I strongly suggest aiming for a \"chance to hit twice\": \"cast at maximum size\": Resource Cost Reduction: Barrier Generation works with: Barrier Generation doesn't work with: Read up more on Attack Speed in our Bosses are immune to Crowd Control (CC) effects and instead take Stagger Damage when hit by one. The amount of stagger damage dealt depends on the type of CC and is proportional to its duration. After being hit by a CC effect, the Boss will temporarily take less Stagger Damage from a CC of the same type. Effectively, this means that when you're just spamming one type of CC you don't need to spam any more of it than what you need to keep a normal enemy permanently CC-d. To stagger the Boss quickly you need to use as many different types of CC as possible. After the Boss is staggered it gains a certain amount of stacking Stagger Damage Reduction for the rest of the fight: Bosses naturally regain 1% of their Stagger HP every second and when that regen is combined with 90% Stagger Damage Reduction it becomes borderline impossible to Stagger the Boss again unless you bring a serious amount of crowd controls. The Quill Volley Spiritborn is a highly mobile allrounder that combines great AoE clear and single target damage."

Here are a few data points showing roll and the required Resource generation to fully restore Vigor: This means that a good affix on is required to have a chance of making the combo with work. Resource Generation stacks multiplicatively with each source. In this build sources are: Intelligence, , Paragon nodes on the board. This leaves you with and/or Resource Generation tempers on jewelry to finish the rest. With good endgame gear, one of these is enough, but before that you may need to add extra tempers and masterwork crits ranks to achieve this result. Stacking more Resource Generation after you have reached the critical point no longer provides any benefit, and if you are overshooting, you instead want to go with Resource Cost Reduction (tempers on Rings), which increases the damage done by consumption effect. Learn more about this interaction in the Before you dive into the Endgame with the Quill Volley Spiritborn, take a look at this overview of the items used in the build. See below for further details about the different progression steps and variants. Some of your Skill Tree choices depend on what items are available to you. Keep in mind that while we can guarantee that everyone has access to the same Aspects, the exact progression is different for everyone. This section is designed to guide your Quill Volley Spiritborn from a fresh level 60 into the very late endgame using the three variants . At the final step, you should be fully decked out with a great all-rounder build. From there, follow the other min/max variants if you want to optimize around certain activities such as If you are fresh in Torment 1 coming from a leveling guide, this is where you begin. Since only some Aspects can be guaranteed from Dungeon unlocks for the , focus on acquiring the additional aspects via gambling with The goal here is to progress through the Torment difficulties as you unlock Ancestrals, Paragon points, all and the most important to pilot this build. Some are used temporarily to fill slots that may be replaced with more items later on. This is the final version of the build's progression, including all regular , leaving you with a great all-rounder build for all content in the game. Additional variants use this as a baseline to optimize around certain activities. This Speedfarming variant optimizes the build for easy activities like Tiers after you have finished the variant and reached a plateau in your progression. This setup optimizes the build to push the highest possible Tiers in after you have finished the variant and reached a plateau in your progression. There are various double-dipping bugs that allow main hall to benefit from damage buffs to the original hit and again for its damage proc. Beware that this build or variants of it include some choices leaning into this interaction, which could be fixed at any moment leading to guide adjustments and a loss of power. However, we believe that a fix to these bugs is very unlikely during Season 9. Known double-dipping interactions occur with the following: since we no longer apply thorns damage reliably and redistribute a few points in various places. This is an alternative lategame setup if you want to try something different, based on stacking up and detonating them with . Thanks to the poison novas from the helm and passive, this build has incredible AoE damage scaling to the moon in large monster packs, but falls off against high tier single target bosses. However, it's still a relatively competent build that can farm and push at acceptable levels. The playstyle and skill setup remain largely the same compared to typical builds, but the Core Skill no longer deals any significant damage.

In this section you can find the answers to the questions that have been asked the most. The build works really well when you decimate everything in seconds, but may get overwhelmed if fights are long against high level monsters. There are several adjustments you can make when you have trouble with more difficult content: If there are times when your isn't doing damage it is most likely because you don't fully restore all Vigor between every hit with spends all of your resource to significantly increase the damage of , add two extra feathers and guaranteed a crit. If that doesn't happen at all, you must invest more into resource generation (e.g. tempers, masterworking on jewelry) or get a better ring. It may also be that you only reach the threshold needed when Measured Ravager is active and your uptime is too low in boss encounters. This build has multiple major progression steps related to your resource generation. Make sure to use at least one of the following: Generally hardcore and softcore share the same builds. Outside of being more prudent in your gameplay, you can also tweak the setup slightly to raise your survivability: The most important stat on is the Vigor restore percent! restores 20 - 50% of the Vigor spent in the last two seconds. The ring tracks how much is spent on your buff bar and consumes the buff on your next crit, so you can't scale its effect by attacking quickly.

In this section you can find the answers to the questions that have been asked the most. The build works really well when you decimate everything in seconds, but may get overwhelmed if fights are long against high level monsters.

It may also be that you only reach the threshold needed when Measured Ravager is active and your uptime is too low in boss encounters. This build has multiple major progression steps related to your resource generation. Make sure to use at least one of the following: Generally hardcore and softcore share the same builds. Outside of being more prudent in your gameplay, you can also tweak the setup slightly to raise your survivability: The most important stat on is the Vigor restore percent! restores 20 - 50% of the Vigor spent in the last two seconds. The ring tracks how much is spent on your buff bar and consumes the buff on your next crit, so you can't scale its effect by attacking quickly. The higher the roll the easier it will be to reach enough resource generation to fully restore your Vigor each attack. If you don't have enough resource generation you will do no damage! To find out how much resource generation your roll needs to fully restore your Vigor follow this formula: Here is a table showing roll and the required Resource generation to fully restore Vigor: When calculating resource generation it is important to remember resource generation is multiplicative. Here is the formula for calculating resource generation: Resource generation = ((100% + Source 1) x (100% + Source 2) x (100% + Source 3) …) - 100% I strongly suggest aiming for a \"chance to hit twice\": \"cast at maximum size\": Resource Cost Reduction: Barrier Generation works with: Barrier Generation doesn't work with: Read up more on Attack Speed in our Bosses are immune to Crowd Control (CC) effects and instead take Stagger Damage when hit by one. The amount of stagger damage dealt depends on the type of CC and is proportional to its duration. After being hit by a CC effect, the Boss will temporarily take less Stagger Damage from a CC of the same type. Effectively, this means that when you're just spamming one type of CC you don't need to spam any more of it than what you need to keep a normal enemy permanently CC-d. To stagger the Boss quickly you need to use as many different types of CC as possible. After the Boss is staggered it gains a certain amount of stacking Stagger Damage Reduction for the rest of the fight: Bosses naturally regain 1% of their Stagger HP every second and when that regen is combined with 90% Stagger Damage Reduction it becomes borderline impossible to Stagger the Boss again unless you bring a serious amount of crowd controls.

In this section you can find the answers to the questions that have been asked the most. The build works really well when you decimate everything in seconds, but may get overwhelmed if fights are long against high level monsters.

It may also be that you only reach the threshold needed when Measured Ravager is active and your uptime is too low in boss encounters. This build has multiple major progression steps related to your resource generation. Make sure to use at least one of the following: Generally hardcore and softcore share the same builds. Outside of being more prudent in your gameplay, you can also tweak the setup slightly to raise your survivability: The most important stat on is the Vigor restore percent! restores 20 - 50% of the Vigor spent in the last two seconds. The ring tracks how much is spent on your buff bar and consumes the buff on your next crit, so you can't scale its effect by attacking quickly. The higher the roll the easier it will be to reach enough resource generation to fully restore your Vigor each attack. If you don't have enough resource generation you will do no damage! To find out how much resource generation your roll needs to fully restore your Vigor follow this formula: Here is a table showing roll and the required Resource generation to fully restore Vigor: When calculating resource generation it is important to remember resource generation is multiplicative. Here is the formula for calculating resource generation: Resource generation = ((100% + Source 1) x (100% + Source 2) x (100% + Source 3) …) - 100% I strongly suggest aiming for a \"chance to hit twice\": \"cast at maximum size\": Resource Cost Reduction: Barrier Generation works with: Barrier Generation doesn't work with: Read up more on Attack Speed in our Bosses are immune to Crowd Control (CC) effects and instead take Stagger Damage when hit by one. The amount of stagger damage dealt depends on the type of CC and is proportional to its duration. After being hit by a CC effect, the Boss will temporarily take less Stagger Damage from a CC of the same type. Effectively, this means that when you're just spamming one type of CC you don't need to spam any more of it than what you need to keep a normal enemy permanently CC-d. To stagger the Boss quickly you need to use as many different types of CC as possible. After the Boss is staggered it gains a certain amount of stacking Stagger Damage Reduction for the rest of the fight: Bosses naturally regain 1% of their Stagger HP every second and when that regen is combined with 90% Stagger Damage Reduction it becomes borderline impossible to Stagger the Boss again unless you bring a serious amount of crowd controls.

To find out how much resource generation your roll needs to fully restore your Vigor follow this formula: Here is a table showing roll and the required Resource generation to fully restore Vigor: When calculating resource generation it is important to remember resource generation is multiplicative. Here is the formula for calculating resource generation: Resource generation = ((100% + Source 1) x (100% + Source 2) x (100% + Source 3) …) - 100% I strongly suggest aiming for a \"chance to hit twice\": \"cast at maximum size\": Resource Cost Reduction: Barrier Generation works with: Barrier Generation doesn't work with: Read up more on Attack Speed in our Bosses are immune to Crowd Control (CC) effects and instead take Stagger Damage when hit by one. The amount of stagger damage dealt depends on the type of CC and is proportional to its duration. After being hit by a CC effect, the Boss will temporarily take less Stagger Damage from a CC of the same type. Effectively, this means that when you're just spamming one type of CC you don't need to spam any more of it than what you need to keep a normal enemy permanently CC-d. To stagger the Boss quickly you need to use as many different types of CC as possible. After the Boss is staggered it gains a certain amount of stacking Stagger Damage Reduction for the rest of the fight: Bosses naturally regain 1% of their Stagger HP every second and when that regen is combined with 90% Stagger Damage Reduction it becomes borderline impossible to Stagger the Boss again unless you bring a serious amount of crowd controls. The Quill Volley Spiritborn is a highly mobile allrounder that combines great AoE clear and single target damage."

However, we believe that a fix to these bugs is very unlikely during Season 9. Known double-dipping interactions occur with the following: since we no longer apply thorns damage reliably and redistribute a few points in various places. This is an alternative lategame setup if you want to try something different, based on stacking up and detonating them with .
