Since you can only have 2 at once and they last 10 seconds, this results in a fairly slow and relaxed playstyle where you don't have to press that many buttons if you don't want to. Sorcerer is not very dependent on any Unique items. Obviously is great, but early on even the base Hydra is pretty good. The Season 9 theme is the .

At around Paragon 200, leveling slows down significantly and all important nodes and Glyph sockets should be unlocked. Afterwards, you can min/max your build with minor tweaks and by picking up additional smaller nodes. Some Glyph position swaps, board changes and other pathing adjustments may occur as you unlock your full potential. The setup displayed by default is the final version of the build before spending additional points that do not significantly impact your character's power. You can have up to two Runewords in your setup, each consisting of one Rune.

See below for further details about the different progression steps and variants. Some of your Skill Tree choices depend on what items are available to you. Keep in mind that while we can guarantee that everyone has access to the same Aspects, the exact progression is different for everyone. This section is designed to guide your Hydra Sorcerer from a fresh level 60 into the very late endgame using the three variants . At the final step, you should be fully decked out with a great all-rounder build. From there, follow the other min/max variants if you want to optimize around certain activities such as If you are fresh in Torment 1 coming from a leveling guide, this is where you begin. Since only some Aspects can be guaranteed from Dungeon unlocks for the , focus on acquiring the additional aspects via gambling with The goal here is to progress through the Torment difficulties as you unlock Ancestrals, Paragon points, all and the most important to pilot this build. Some are used temporarily to fill slots that may be replaced with more items later on. This is the final version of the build's progression, including all regular , leaving you with a great all-rounder build for all content in the game. Additional variants use this as a baseline to optimize around certain activities. This Speedfarming variant optimizes the build for easy activities like Tiers after you have finished the variant and reached a plateau in your progression. To go fast with Hydra Sorcerer there's two things you need to do: In order to meet the first objective we need to get the cooldown of our Evade low enough to reset it with a single cast of . With perfect gear you can do it simply by masterworking Evade Cooldown Reduction on your Boots and keep your Staff. If you're missing a bit of CDR you have to go Wand + Focus with CDR (and ). The latter setup is also slightly better because of faster cast animations but if you can reach the CDR breakpoint without it, it's generally not worth bothering. In order to spam we need to generate a ton of Mana. To that end we use: Combined with all other sources of Mana Regen we already have in the build such as , this should boost your Mana Regen to over 500 per second! Since we don't have time to cast on anything that isn't a boss, we replace if with . This gives us Attack Speed, stacks, some Vulnerable application and it also lets us maintain permanent Crackling Energy (with some help from tempers on Boots and Gloves). On our paragon boards we replace the last 2 boards with to have more upfront unconditional damage: Finally, for runes we use for consistent damage bonuses and more Teleport ranks. If your CDR is not high enough for perma dips below 10 stacks, replace This setup optimizes the build to push the highest possible Tiers in after you have finished the variant and reached a plateau in your progression. In order to maximize the damage output of the build we use . This item gives a lot of Intelligence and double damage. Since this build has a lot of downtime between casts, it's easy to shoot here and there in order to keep up the buff. We have to lose but in high tier pits the Enchantment alone is more than enough. To compensate for the lost Armor your Boots need to have it in place of Mana Per Second. this build already becomes somewhat squishy but if you want to push it even further you can take points out of for 1.15x damage multiplier. Once a guide is released, many players have questions on why and how we are approaching certain choices. In this section you can find the answers to the questions that have been asked the most. The build works really well when you decimate everything in seconds, but may get overwhelmed if fights are long against high level monsters. There are several adjustments you can make when you have trouble with more difficult content: does not get extra heads from Weapon Temper or from implicit stats. It always spawns with 5 Heads, or rather 3 Heads and +200% extra damage. This alone makes it 5 times weaker than your regular Hydras. On top of that it has a conflict with because it spawns after you already spend all your Mana and doesn't get any bonus damage. This build has a lot of Crit Chance bonuses that don't display in your Stat Sheet: Together, these add up to +90% Crit Chance which instantly lets you reach the cap of 100% without any rolls on gear. The only exception to that is high tier Pit Pushing where is often inactive. There you want to have around 140% effective Crit Chance. Luckily a with a Greater Affix on Crit can take care of that singlehandedly. Each Hydra head will attack the closest enemy at a constant rate that scales with the player's Attack Speed. Hydra attacks immediately upon spawn but casting Hydra repeatedly doesn't make them attack faster than they normally would. Sorcerer offers a slow and relaxed way to play Sorcerer. While a fully optimized playstyle can be as involved as any other build, you can get 70-80% of its efficiency simply by pressing 1 button every 5 seconds. If typical for a Sorcerer high-octane 400 APM gameplay is not for you, give Hydra a shot!"

Keep in mind that while we can guarantee that everyone has access to the same Aspects, the exact progression is different for everyone. This section is designed to guide your Hydra Sorcerer from a fresh level 60 into the very late endgame using the three variants .

This is the final version of the build's progression, including all regular , leaving you with a great all-rounder build for all content in the game. Additional variants use this as a baseline to optimize around certain activities. This Speedfarming variant optimizes the build for easy activities like Tiers after you have finished the variant and reached a plateau in your progression. To go fast with Hydra Sorcerer there's two things you need to do: In order to meet the first objective we need to get the cooldown of our Evade low enough to reset it with a single cast of . With perfect gear you can do it simply by masterworking Evade Cooldown Reduction on your Boots and keep your Staff. If you're missing a bit of CDR you have to go Wand + Focus with CDR (and ). The latter setup is also slightly better because of faster cast animations but if you can reach the CDR breakpoint without it, it's generally not worth bothering. In order to spam we need to generate a ton of Mana. To that end we use: Combined with all other sources of Mana Regen we already have in the build such as , this should boost your Mana Regen to over 500 per second! Since we don't have time to cast on anything that isn't a boss, we replace if with . This gives us Attack Speed, stacks, some Vulnerable application and it also lets us maintain permanent Crackling Energy (with some help from tempers on Boots and Gloves). On our paragon boards we replace the last 2 boards with to have more upfront unconditional damage: Finally, for runes we use for consistent damage bonuses and more Teleport ranks. If your CDR is not high enough for perma dips below 10 stacks, replace This setup optimizes the build to push the highest possible Tiers in after you have finished the variant and reached a plateau in your progression. In order to maximize the damage output of the build we use . This item gives a lot of Intelligence and double damage. Since this build has a lot of downtime between casts, it's easy to shoot here and there in order to keep up the buff. We have to lose but in high tier pits the Enchantment alone is more than enough. To compensate for the lost Armor your Boots need to have it in place of Mana Per Second. this build already becomes somewhat squishy but if you want to push it even further you can take points out of for 1.15x damage multiplier. Once a guide is released, many players have questions on why and how we are approaching certain choices. In this section you can find the answers to the questions that have been asked the most. The build works really well when you decimate everything in seconds, but may get overwhelmed if fights are long against high level monsters. There are several adjustments you can make when you have trouble with more difficult content: does not get extra heads from Weapon Temper or from implicit stats. It always spawns with 5 Heads, or rather 3 Heads and +200% extra damage. This alone makes it 5 times weaker than your regular Hydras. On top of that it has a conflict with because it spawns after you already spend all your Mana and doesn't get any bonus damage. This build has a lot of Crit Chance bonuses that don't display in your Stat Sheet: Together, these add up to +90% Crit Chance which instantly lets you reach the cap of 100% without any rolls on gear. The only exception to that is high tier Pit Pushing where is often inactive. There you want to have around 140% effective Crit Chance. Luckily a with a Greater Affix on Crit can take care of that singlehandedly. Each Hydra head will attack the closest enemy at a constant rate that scales with the player's Attack Speed. Hydra attacks immediately upon spawn but casting Hydra repeatedly doesn't make them attack faster than they normally would. Sorcerer offers a slow and relaxed way to play Sorcerer. While a fully optimized playstyle can be as involved as any other build, you can get 70-80% of its efficiency simply by pressing 1 button every 5 seconds.

On top of that it has a conflict with because it spawns after you already spend all your Mana and doesn't get any bonus damage. This build has a lot of Crit Chance bonuses that don't display in your Stat Sheet: Together, these add up to +90% Crit Chance which instantly lets you reach the cap of 100% without any rolls on gear. The only exception to that is high tier Pit Pushing where is often inactive. There you want to have around 140% effective Crit Chance. Luckily a with a Greater Affix on Crit can take care of that singlehandedly. Each Hydra head will attack the closest enemy at a constant rate that scales with the player's Attack Speed. Hydra attacks immediately upon spawn but casting Hydra repeatedly doesn't make them attack faster than they normally would. Sorcerer offers a slow and relaxed way to play Sorcerer. While a fully optimized playstyle can be as involved as any other build, you can get 70-80% of its efficiency simply by pressing 1 button every 5 seconds.

This Speedfarming variant optimizes the build for easy activities like Tiers after you have finished the variant and reached a plateau in your progression. To go fast with Hydra Sorcerer there's two things you need to do: In order to meet the first objective we need to get the cooldown of our Evade low enough to reset it with a single cast of . With perfect gear you can do it simply by masterworking Evade Cooldown Reduction on your Boots and keep your Staff. If you're missing a bit of CDR you have to go Wand + Focus with CDR (and ). The latter setup is also slightly better because of faster cast animations but if you can reach the CDR breakpoint without it, it's generally not worth bothering. In order to spam we need to generate a ton of Mana. To that end we use: Combined with all other sources of Mana Regen we already have in the build such as , this should boost your Mana Regen to over 500 per second! Since we don't have time to cast on anything that isn't a boss, we replace if with . This gives us Attack Speed, stacks, some Vulnerable application and it also lets us maintain permanent Crackling Energy (with some help from tempers on Boots and Gloves). On our paragon boards we replace the last 2 boards with to have more upfront unconditional damage: Finally, for runes we use for consistent damage bonuses and more Teleport ranks. If your CDR is not high enough for perma dips below 10 stacks, replace This setup optimizes the build to push the highest possible Tiers in after you have finished the variant and reached a plateau in your progression. In order to maximize the damage output of the build we use . This item gives a lot of Intelligence and double damage. Since this build has a lot of downtime between casts, it's easy to shoot here and there in order to keep up the buff. We have to lose but in high tier pits the Enchantment alone is more than enough. To compensate for the lost Armor your Boots need to have it in place of Mana Per Second. this build already becomes somewhat squishy but if you want to push it even further you can take points out of for 1.15x damage multiplier. Once a guide is released, many players have questions on why and how we are approaching certain choices. In this section you can find the answers to the questions that have been asked the most. The build works really well when you decimate everything in seconds, but may get overwhelmed if fights are long against high level monsters. There are several adjustments you can make when you have trouble with more difficult content: does not get extra heads from Weapon Temper or from implicit stats. It always spawns with 5 Heads, or rather 3 Heads and +200% extra damage. This alone makes it 5 times weaker than your regular Hydras. On top of that it has a conflict with because it spawns after you already spend all your Mana and doesn't get any bonus damage. This build has a lot of Crit Chance bonuses that don't display in your Stat Sheet: Together, these add up to +90% Crit Chance which instantly lets you reach the cap of 100% without any rolls on gear. The only exception to that is high tier Pit Pushing where is often inactive. There you want to have around 140% effective Crit Chance. Luckily a with a Greater Affix on Crit can take care of that singlehandedly. Each Hydra head will attack the closest enemy at a constant rate that scales with the player's Attack Speed. Hydra attacks immediately upon spawn but casting Hydra repeatedly doesn't make them attack faster than they normally would. Sorcerer offers a slow and relaxed way to play Sorcerer.
