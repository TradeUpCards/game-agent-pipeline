Additional variants use this as a baseline to optimize around certain activities. The Speedfarming variant optimizes the build for easy activities like Tiers after you have finished the variant and reached a plateau in your progression. This setup optimizes the build to push the highest possible Tiers in after you have finished the variant and reached a plateau in your progression. Once a guide is released, many players have questions on why and how we are approaching certain choices. In this section you can find the answers to the questions that have been asked the most. During your early progression you will need to manage this with the following until you can achieve 100% value on the Lucky Hit Chance to Restore Primary Resource affix. Essence per Second (EPS) affix on the Helm, Chest and Boots helps to passively replace Essence as you cast your damage skills. Resource Cost Reduction reduces the cost of every skill by a percentage equal to the total on your gear. Since the base rolls of EPS add up to 12 and the Necromancer regains 3 EPS, you generate a total of 15 per second. To completely replace the Essence loss of 1 cast per second you need 40% Resource Cost Reduction. This would allow you to go \"infinite\", meaning you would never run out of Essence. When casting your skills more than once per second, you need more of both stat to achieve this equilibrium. This can be valued at over 100% of your resource.  Making sure you have enough Lucky Hit Chance will ensure a high uptime on this affix. Another layer of importance of Lucky Hit Chance with this build.

The amount of stagger damage dealt depends on the type of CC and is proportional to its duration. After being hit by a CC effect, the Boss will temporarily take less Stagger Damage from a CC of the same type. Effectively, this means that when you're just spamming one type of CC you don't need to spam any more of it than what you need to keep a normal enemy permanently CC-d. To stagger the Boss quickly you need to use as many different types of CC as possible. After the Boss is staggered it gains a certain amount of stacking Stagger Damage Reduction for the rest of the fight: Bosses naturally regain 1% of their Stagger HP every second and when that regen is combined with 90% Stagger Damage Reduction it becomes borderline impossible to Stagger the Boss again unless you bring a serious amount of crowd controls.

This setup optimizes the build to push the highest possible Tiers in after you have finished the variant and reached a plateau in your progression. Once a guide is released, many players have questions on why and how we are approaching certain choices. In this section you can find the answers to the questions that have been asked the most. During your early progression you will need to manage this with the following until you can achieve 100% value on the Lucky Hit Chance to Restore Primary Resource affix. Essence per Second (EPS) affix on the Helm, Chest and Boots helps to passively replace Essence as you cast your damage skills. Resource Cost Reduction reduces the cost of every skill by a percentage equal to the total on your gear. Since the base rolls of EPS add up to 12 and the Necromancer regains 3 EPS, you generate a total of 15 per second. To completely replace the Essence loss of 1 cast per second you need 40% Resource Cost Reduction. This would allow you to go \"infinite\", meaning you would never run out of Essence. When casting your skills more than once per second, you need more of both stat to achieve this equilibrium. This can be valued at over 100% of your resource.  Making sure you have enough Lucky Hit Chance will ensure a high uptime on this affix. Another layer of importance of Lucky Hit Chance with this build.

If you have 100 , it gains 400% bonus damage, or a five times multiplier of its damage. It applies its damage in a small radius around itself, on impact. This radius can be increased with tempers on gear. Generally hardcore and softcore share the same builds. Other than going slower and paying more attention to threats around you, there are some imporant things to consider: Read up more on Attack Speed in our Read up more on Attack Speed in our Bosses are immune to Crowd Control (CC) effects and instead take Stagger Damage when hit by one. The amount of stagger damage dealt depends on the type of CC and is proportional to its duration. After being hit by a CC effect, the Boss will temporarily take less Stagger Damage from a CC of the same type. Effectively, this means that when you're just spamming one type of CC you don't need to spam any more of it than what you need to keep a normal enemy permanently CC-d. To stagger the Boss quickly you need to use as many different types of CC as possible. After the Boss is staggered it gains a certain amount of stacking Stagger Damage Reduction for the rest of the fight: Bosses naturally regain 1% of their Stagger HP every second and when that regen is combined with 90% Stagger Damage Reduction it becomes borderline impossible to Stagger the Boss again unless you bring a serious amount of crowd controls. The Bone Spirit Necromancer has the highest scaling damage in the game, in a single skill. It has often been the best Boss Killer and reaches Billions of Damage with ease!

During your early progression you will need to manage this with the following until you can achieve 100% value on the Lucky Hit Chance to Restore Primary Resource affix. Essence per Second (EPS) affix on the Helm, Chest and Boots helps to passively replace Essence as you cast your damage skills. Resource Cost Reduction reduces the cost of every skill by a percentage equal to the total on your gear. Since the base rolls of EPS add up to 12 and the Necromancer regains 3 EPS, you generate a total of 15 per second. To completely replace the Essence loss of 1 cast per second you need 40% Resource Cost Reduction. This would allow you to go \"infinite\", meaning you would never run out of Essence. When casting your skills more than once per second, you need more of both stat to achieve this equilibrium. This can be valued at over 100% of your resource.

The amount of stagger damage dealt depends on the type of CC and is proportional to its duration.

To stagger the Boss quickly you need to use as many different types of CC as possible. After the Boss is staggered it gains a certain amount of stacking Stagger Damage Reduction for the rest of the fight: Bosses naturally regain 1% of their Stagger HP every second and when that regen is combined with 90% Stagger Damage Reduction it becomes borderline impossible to Stagger the Boss again unless you bring a serious amount of crowd controls.
