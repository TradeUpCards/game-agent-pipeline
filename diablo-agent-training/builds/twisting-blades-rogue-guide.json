In this section, you can find the answers to the questions that have been asked the most about the Twisting Blades Rogue Build. The build works really well when you decimate everything in seconds, but may get overwhelmed if fights are long against high level monsters. There are several adjustments you can make when you have trouble with more difficult content: is mainly used for the 5 seconds of Unstoppable that it provides through In the early game, you may occasionally starve on resources before you get the full combo online. The Starter version can use Inner Sight to counter this. Once you have the Ancestral version, resources should feel pretty comfortable. Alternatively, investing more into Resource Cost Reduction (esp. on Crossbow) helps with this.

Although the imbuement has charges, if your imbued ability hits multiple times per cast, the skill applies the imbuement with every damage instance. This implies that tempering that allows your skills to hit multiple times is excellent for frequently applying to the target. To understand how its damage is calculated and how DoT duration influences the damage dealt, refer to the Damage Calculations accordion below. uses the base damage of the ability it imbues in its damage calculation, meaning the skill % (including multiplier) and weapon damage from the imbued skill.

This implies that anything multiplying your core damage, such as , does not work for Importantly, the damage from is calculated as a summation of poisoning damage. This means each time you attack with , you add poisoning damage onto the target. This is then distributed over its full duration across each damage instance. To illustrate this quickly, we can use a quick math example: The consequence of the damage being calculated this way is that adding duration to increases the top-end proportionally to the increased duration. For example, adding to the example above would result in a 41% damage increase once the damage starts declining (as shown below). The Lucky Hit Chance per damage instance for is calculated according to the following formula: Because this formula has (100% - Tooltip LHC%) as a part of its calculation, it was theorized that you gain no more benefit from Lucky Hit once you reach 100% Tooltip Lucky Hit. If the theory was correct, as (100% - Tooltip LHC%) approaches 0, the chance to trigger Lucky Hit effects skyrockets until finally getting to 100% Lucky Hit per tick.

After being hit by a CC effect, the Boss will temporarily take less Stagger Damage from CC of the same type. Effectively, this means that when you're just spamming one type of CC you don't need to spam any more of it than what you need to keep a normal enemy permanently CC-d. To stagger the Boss quickly you need to use as many different types of CC as possible. After the Boss is staggered it gains a certain amount of stacking Stagger Damage Reduction for the rest of the fight: Bosses naturally regain 1% of their Stagger HP every second and when that regen is combined with 90% Stagger Damage Reduction it becomes borderline impossible to Stagger the Boss again.

Although the imbuement has charges, if your imbued ability hits multiple times per cast, the skill applies the imbuement with every damage instance. This implies that tempering that allows your skills to hit multiple times is excellent for frequently applying to the target. To understand how its damage is calculated and how DoT duration influences the damage dealt, refer to the Damage Calculations accordion below. uses the base damage of the ability it imbues in its damage calculation, meaning the skill % (including multiplier) and weapon damage from the imbued skill.

This means each time you attack with , you add poisoning damage onto the target. This is then distributed over its full duration across each damage instance. To illustrate this quickly, we can use a quick math example: The consequence of the damage being calculated this way is that adding duration to increases the top-end proportionally to the increased duration. For example, adding to the example above would result in a 41% damage increase once the damage starts declining (as shown below). The Lucky Hit Chance per damage instance for is calculated according to the following formula: Because this formula has (100% - Tooltip LHC%) as a part of its calculation, it was theorized that you gain no more benefit from Lucky Hit once you reach 100% Tooltip Lucky Hit. If the theory was correct, as (100% - Tooltip LHC%) approaches 0, the chance to trigger Lucky Hit effects skyrockets until finally getting to 100% Lucky Hit per tick.

The amount of stagger damage dealt depends on the type of CC and is proportional to its duration. After being hit by a CC effect, the Boss will temporarily take less Stagger Damage from CC of the same type. Effectively, this means that when you're just spamming one type of CC you don't need to spam any more of it than what you need to keep a normal enemy permanently CC-d. To stagger the Boss quickly you need to use as many different types of CC as possible. After the Boss is staggered it gains a certain amount of stacking Stagger Damage Reduction for the rest of the fight: Bosses naturally regain 1% of their Stagger HP every second and when that regen is combined with 90% Stagger Damage Reduction it becomes borderline impossible to Stagger the Boss again.

For example, adding to the example above would result in a 41% damage increase once the damage starts declining (as shown below). The Lucky Hit Chance per damage instance for is calculated according to the following formula: Because this formula has (100% - Tooltip LHC%) as a part of its calculation, it was theorized that you gain no more benefit from Lucky Hit once you reach 100% Tooltip Lucky Hit.

The amount of stagger damage dealt depends on the type of CC and is proportional to its duration. After being hit by a CC effect, the Boss will temporarily take less Stagger Damage from CC of the same type. Effectively, this means that when you're just spamming one type of CC you don't need to spam any more of it than what you need to keep a normal enemy permanently CC-d. To stagger the Boss quickly you need to use as many different types of CC as possible. After the Boss is staggered it gains a certain amount of stacking Stagger Damage Reduction for the rest of the fight: Bosses naturally regain 1% of their Stagger HP every second and when that regen is combined with 90% Stagger Damage Reduction it becomes borderline impossible to Stagger the Boss again.

After being hit by a CC effect, the Boss will temporarily take less Stagger Damage from CC of the same type. Effectively, this means that when you're just spamming one type of CC you don't need to spam any more of it than what you need to keep a normal enemy permanently CC-d. To stagger the Boss quickly you need to use as many different types of CC as possible.

For example, adding to the example above would result in a 41% damage increase once the damage starts declining (as shown below). The Lucky Hit Chance per damage instance for is calculated according to the following formula: Because this formula has (100% - Tooltip LHC%) as a part of its calculation, it was theorized that you gain no more benefit from Lucky Hit once you reach 100% Tooltip Lucky Hit.

Effectively, this means that when you're just spamming one type of CC you don't need to spam any more of it than what you need to keep a normal enemy permanently CC-d. To stagger the Boss quickly you need to use as many different types of CC as possible.

Additional variants use this as a baseline to optimize around certain activities. This variant requires incenses to cap out your Armor and Resistances. If you wish to cap without it, you have to sacrifice damage by masterworking Armor and Resistance to All Elements instead. This setup optimizes the build to push the highest possible Tiers in after you have finished the variant and reached a plateau in your progression. This Variant is a completely different build archetype, but it is the strongest build utilizing for Pit Pushing. This is expected to be updated frequently to cover the latest changes to the build. This setup optimizes the build to push the highest possible Tiers in after you have finished the variant and reached a plateau in your progression. Thank you for playtesting and figuring out a very min-max version of this build for Not a lot changes between the variant and the variant, except for how you reset your and some minor details: Once a guide is released, many players have questions on why and how we are approaching certain choices. In this section, you can find the answers to the questions that have been asked the most about the Twisting Blades Rogue Build. The build works really well when you decimate everything in seconds, but may get overwhelmed if fights are long against high level monsters. There are several adjustments you can make when you have trouble with more difficult content: is mainly used for the 5 seconds of Unstoppable that it provides through In the early game, you may occasionally starve on resources before you get the full combo online. The Starter version can use Inner Sight to counter this. Once you have the Ancestral version, resources should feel pretty comfortable. Alternatively, investing more into Resource Cost Reduction (esp. on Crossbow) helps with this. Additionally, you can put more points into or temper Resource Generation, Resource Cost Reduction, or Lucky Hit: Chance to restore Resource on your rings.

Although the imbuement has charges, if your imbued ability hits multiple times per cast, the skill applies the imbuement with every damage instance. This implies that tempering that allows your skills to hit multiple times is excellent for frequently applying to the target. To understand how its damage is calculated and how DoT duration influences the damage dealt, refer to the Damage Calculations accordion below. uses the base damage of the ability it imbues in its damage calculation, meaning the skill % (including multiplier) and weapon damage from the imbued skill. This could be summarized as: Essentially, it is the standard damage calculation (which can be found in our ) with the addition of one more skill % and multiplier if you play with . This implies that anything multiplying your core damage, such as , does not work for Importantly, the damage from is calculated as a summation of poisoning damage. This means each time you attack with , you add poisoning damage onto the target. This is then distributed over its full duration across each damage instance. To illustrate this quickly, we can use a quick math example: The consequence of the damage being calculated this way is that adding duration to increases the top-end proportionally to the increased duration. For example, adding to the example above would result in a 41% damage increase once the damage starts declining (as shown below). The Lucky Hit Chance per damage instance for is calculated according to the following formula: Because this formula has (100% - Tooltip LHC%) as a part of its calculation, it was theorized that you gain no more benefit from Lucky Hit once you reach 100% Tooltip Lucky Hit. If the theory was correct, as (100% - Tooltip LHC%) approaches 0, the chance to trigger Lucky Hit effects skyrockets until finally getting to 100% Lucky Hit per tick. At 203.03% Lucky Hit, we would have had 99.99% Tooltip Lucky Hit and an expected proc total of X'fals triggers. This was not nearly the case, and similar tests were conducted at other Lucky Hit values to verify this functionality. Further testing has to be conducted, but based on this test, the following was true for More on Lucky Hit functionality in our The game has a stat called imbuement potency, which can be found on things such as . Potency increases the effectiveness of the imbuement you use. A misconception within the community was that imbuement potency increased the passive benefits from the enhancement nodes such as . This has been verified not to be the case, it only increases the functionality of the base skill. The following interactions have been verified through damage recording or footage to ensure they are functional. Anything not listed here has not explicitly been verified during the creation of this list. Bosses are immune to Crowd Control (CC) and instead take Stagger Damage when hit by one. The amount of stagger damage dealt depends on the type of CC and is proportional to its duration. After being hit by a CC effect, the Boss will temporarily take less Stagger Damage from CC of the same type. Effectively, this means that when you're just spamming one type of CC you don't need to spam any more of it than what you need to keep a normal enemy permanently CC-d. To stagger the Boss quickly you need to use as many different types of CC as possible. After the Boss is staggered it gains a certain amount of stacking Stagger Damage Reduction for the rest of the fight: Bosses naturally regain 1% of their Stagger HP every second and when that regen is combined with 90% Stagger Damage Reduction it becomes borderline impossible to Stagger the Boss again.
