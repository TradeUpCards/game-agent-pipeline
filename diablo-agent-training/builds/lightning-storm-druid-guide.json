The amount of stagger damage dealt depends on the type of CC and is proportional to its duration. After being hit by a CC effect, the Boss will temporarily take less Stagger Damage from a CC of the same type. Effectively, this means that when you're just spamming one type of CC you don't need to spam any more of it than what you need to keep a normal enemy permanently CC-d. To stagger the Boss quickly you need to use as many different types of CC as possible. After the Boss is staggered it gains a certain amount of stacking Stagger Damage Reduction for the rest of the fight: Bosses naturally regain 1% of their Stagger HP every second and when that regen is combined with 90% Stagger Damage Reduction it becomes borderline impossible to Stagger the Boss again unless you bring a serious amount of crowd controls.

In this section you can find the answers to the questions that have been asked the most. Druid uses a One-Handed Weapon + Totem setup to take advantage of multiple powerful and the superior base Attack Speed. While any One-Handed Weapon is suitable, the is especially good because it boasts the highest Attacks per Second. During Leveling a Two-Handed is preferred for its Vulnerable additive and ability to double the grants permanent while active. Alternatively, Druids have only two non-Ultimate sources of . If you're not subscribed to their long Cooldown, is a great alternative to those skills. In the early game you may occasionally starve on resources before you get Shapeshifting synergies online. It is recommended you invest in per second while you look for . Alternatively, utilize , or you can imprint Resource Aspects such as Generally hardcore and softcore share the same builds. Outside of being more prudent in your gameplay, you can also tweak the setup slightly to raise your survivability: Shapeshifting into new form adds 5 stacks of Wildheart, up to 50, increasing the bonuses of your by 5%[+]. These increases are additive, resulting in up to +50[x] damage and +50% Attack Speed to your bonuses. However, Wildheart stacks decrease at a rate of one per second (-0.5%[x] per second), essentially requiring a new Shapeshifting form every 10 seconds in order to maintain the maximum stacks. For a more detailed explanation, read up more on Attack Speed in our Bosses are immune to Crowd Control (CC) effects and instead take Stagger Damage when hit by one. The amount of stagger damage dealt depends on the type of CC and is proportional to its duration. After being hit by a CC effect, the Boss will temporarily take less Stagger Damage from a CC of the same type. Effectively, this means that when you're just spamming one type of CC you don't need to spam any more of it than what you need to keep a normal enemy permanently CC-d. To stagger the Boss quickly you need to use as many different types of CC as possible. After the Boss is staggered it gains a certain amount of stacking Stagger Damage Reduction for the rest of the fight: Bosses naturally regain 1% of their Stagger HP every second and when that regen is combined with 90% Stagger Damage Reduction it becomes borderline impossible to Stagger the Boss again unless you bring a serious amount of crowd controls.
