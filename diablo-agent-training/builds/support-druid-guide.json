At around Paragon 200, leveling slows down significantly and all important nodes and Glyph sockets should be unlocked.

It's worth mentioning, though, that the Support Druid has a tough time obtaining Rare Node bonuses in later boards, so Paragon points beyond the example above can be spent on Core Stats to attempt to meet those requirements. You can have up to two Runewords in your setup, each consisting of one Rune. Socket them in Two-Handed Weapons if your build calls for them, otherwise place them into your Armor pieces to replace normal gems.

Keep in mind that certain stats, such as Armor, Resistances, Extra Size Tempers, Attack Speed, and more, have caps that may affect your priorities according to the items and Paragon points available at that moment. Before you dive into the Endgame with the Support Druid, take a look at this overview of the items used in the build. See below for further details about the different progression steps and variants. Some of your Skill Tree choices depend on what items are available to you. Keep in mind that while we can guarantee that everyone has access to the same Aspects, the exact progression is different for everyone. Once a guide is released, many players have questions on why and how we are approaching certain choices. In this section you can find the answers to the questions that have been asked the most. We need to use a 2-Hander to make the most of shared bonus. A staff is preferred, as it has the highest base Attack Speed of any 2-Hander. After being subjected to 10 consecutive seconds of \"Hard\" Crowd Control (freeze, immobilize, stun, etc.), regular monsters become for 10 seconds. For Elites, it only takes 5 seconds of \"Hard\" Crowd Control to activate this effect, decaying after about 8 seconds. \"Soft\" Crowd Controls, such as Slow, build up this immunity at about 1/5 the rate. Before provoking , you can leave the monsters to rest for a short time to let this buildup toward CC immunity decay. As a result, it's important to assess and manage the Crowd Controls available across your party. Note that the Damage Reduction from still applies to Bosses are immune to Crowd Control (CC) effects and instead take Stagger Damage when hit by one. The amount of stagger damage dealt depends on the type of CC and is proportional to its duration. After being hit by a CC effect, the Boss will temporarily take less Stagger Damage from a CC of the same type. Effectively, this means that when you're just spamming one type of CC you don't need to spam any more of it than what you need to keep a normal enemy permanently CC-d. To stagger the Boss quickly you need to use as many different types of CC as possible. After the Boss is staggered it gains a certain amount of stacking Stagger Damage Reduction for the rest of the fight: Bosses naturally regain 1% of their Stagger HP every second and when that regen is combined with 90% Stagger Damage Reduction it becomes borderline impossible to Stagger the Boss again unless you bring a serious amount of crowd controls. The Support Druid offers its party a plethora of Offensive, Defensive, and Utility-based bonuses, not least of which is the 100% multiplicative bonus from .

Before you dive into the Endgame with the Support Druid, take a look at this overview of the items used in the build. See below for further details about the different progression steps and variants. Some of your Skill Tree choices depend on what items are available to you. Keep in mind that while we can guarantee that everyone has access to the same Aspects, the exact progression is different for everyone.

The amount of stagger damage dealt depends on the type of CC and is proportional to its duration. After being hit by a CC effect, the Boss will temporarily take less Stagger Damage from a CC of the same type. Effectively, this means that when you're just spamming one type of CC you don't need to spam any more of it than what you need to keep a normal enemy permanently CC-d. To stagger the Boss quickly you need to use as many different types of CC as possible. After the Boss is staggered it gains a certain amount of stacking Stagger Damage Reduction for the rest of the fight: Bosses naturally regain 1% of their Stagger HP every second and when that regen is combined with 90% Stagger Damage Reduction it becomes borderline impossible to Stagger the Boss again unless you bring a serious amount of crowd controls.
