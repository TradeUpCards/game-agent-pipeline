The amount of stagger damage dealt depends on the type of CC and is proportional to its duration. After being hit by a CC effect, the Boss will temporarily take less Stagger Damage from a CC of the same type.

To stagger the Boss quickly you need to use as many different types of CC as possible.

The Stormclaw Druid is a simple-to-play, speedy build that comfortably tackles all content. It is a little limited relative to other Druid builds when it comes to Pit Pushing, but does reasonably well in Open World content thanks to additional mobility from Shred and additional range from Paingorger's Gauntlets.

The Pit Push variant is quite similar to the variant, with just a couple changes: Once a guide is released, many players have questions on why and how we are approaching certain choices. In this section you can find the answers to the questions that have been asked the most. The build works really well when you decimate everything in seconds, but may get overwhelmed if fights are long against high level monsters.

Outside of being more prudent in your gameplay, you can also tweak the setup slightly to raise your survivability: Read up more on Attack Speed in our Bosses are immune to Crowd Control (CC) effects and instead take Stagger Damage when hit by one. The amount of stagger damage dealt depends on the type of CC and is proportional to its duration. After being hit by a CC effect, the Boss will temporarily take less Stagger Damage from a CC of the same type. Effectively, this means that when you're just spamming one type of CC you don't need to spam any more of it than what you need to keep a normal enemy permanently CC-d. To stagger the Boss quickly you need to use as many different types of CC as possible. After the Boss is staggered it gains a certain amount of stacking Stagger Damage Reduction for the rest of the fight: Bosses naturally regain 1% of their Stagger HP every second and when that regen is combined with 90% Stagger Damage Reduction it becomes borderline impossible to Stagger the Boss again unless you bring a serious amount of crowd controls. The Stormclaw Druid is a simple-to-play, speedy build that comfortably tackles all content. It is a little limited relative to other Druid builds when it comes to Pit Pushing, but does reasonably well in Open World content thanks to additional mobility from Shred and additional range from Paingorger's Gauntlets.

The amount of stagger damage dealt depends on the type of CC and is proportional to its duration. After being hit by a CC effect, the Boss will temporarily take less Stagger Damage from a CC of the same type. Effectively, this means that when you're just spamming one type of CC you don't need to spam any more of it than what you need to keep a normal enemy permanently CC-d. To stagger the Boss quickly you need to use as many different types of CC as possible. After the Boss is staggered it gains a certain amount of stacking Stagger Damage Reduction for the rest of the fight: Bosses naturally regain 1% of their Stagger HP every second and when that regen is combined with 90% Stagger Damage Reduction it becomes borderline impossible to Stagger the Boss again unless you bring a serious amount of crowd controls. The Stormclaw Druid is a simple-to-play, speedy build that comfortably tackles all content. It is a little limited relative to other Druid builds when it comes to Pit Pushing, but does reasonably well in Open World content thanks to additional mobility from Shred and additional range from Paingorger's Gauntlets.
