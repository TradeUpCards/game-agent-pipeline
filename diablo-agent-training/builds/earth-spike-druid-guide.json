At around Paragon 200, leveling slows down significantly and all important nodes and Glyph sockets should be unlocked. Afterwards, you can min/max your build with minor tweaks and by picking up additional smaller nodes. Some Glyph position swaps, board changes and other pathing adjustments may occur as you unlock your full potential. The setup displayed by default is the final version of the build before spending additional points that do not significantly impact your character's power. You can have up to two Runewords in your setup, each consisting of one Rune. Socket them in Two-Handed Weapons if your build calls for them, otherwise place them into your Armor pieces to replace normal gems.

Before you dive into the Endgame with the Earth Spike Druid, take a look at this overview of the items used in the build. See below for further details about the different progression steps and variants. Some of your Skill Tree choices depend on what items are available to you.

Effectively, this means that when you're just spamming one type of CC you don't need to spam any more of it than what you need to keep a normal enemy permanently CC-d. To stagger the Boss quickly you need to use as many different types of CC as possible. After the Boss is staggered it gains a certain amount of stacking Stagger Damage Reduction for the rest of the fight: Bosses naturally regain 1% of their Stagger HP every second and when that regen is combined with 90% Stagger Damage Reduction it becomes borderline impossible to Stagger the Boss again unless you bring a serious amount of crowd controls.

Once you acquire the build's core Uniques, its playstyle is among the simplest for Druids. By leveraging Grizzly Rage and stacking health, it's tanky enough to stand in the middle of the fight and continue dishing out damage, but prefers to stay at range to leverage Nature's Reach.

The amount of stagger damage dealt depends on the type of CC and is proportional to its duration. After being hit by a CC effect, the Boss will temporarily take less Stagger Damage from a CC of the same type. Effectively, this means that when you're just spamming one type of CC you don't need to spam any more of it than what you need to keep a normal enemy permanently CC-d. To stagger the Boss quickly you need to use as many different types of CC as possible. After the Boss is staggered it gains a certain amount of stacking Stagger Damage Reduction for the rest of the fight: Bosses naturally regain 1% of their Stagger HP every second and when that regen is combined with 90% Stagger Damage Reduction it becomes borderline impossible to Stagger the Boss again unless you bring a serious amount of crowd controls. The Earth Spike Druid excels in Boss battles and other small skirmishes, while being somewhat limited in its AoE and speedfarming potential. Once you acquire the build's core Uniques, its playstyle is among the simplest for Druids. By leveraging Grizzly Rage and stacking health, it's tanky enough to stand in the middle of the fight and continue dishing out damage, but prefers to stay at range to leverage Nature's Reach. Proper positioning and targeting are paramount, enabling you to hit more enemies along its narrow area of effect and potentially allowing for multiple hits against larger enemies. Reviewed by"

Once you acquire the build's core Uniques, its playstyle is among the simplest for Druids. By leveraging Grizzly Rage and stacking health, it's tanky enough to stand in the middle of the fight and continue dishing out damage, but prefers to stay at range to leverage Nature's Reach.

For Druids, these two caps are distributed in the following way: Read up more on Attack Speed in our Bosses are immune to Crowd Control (CC) effects and instead take Stagger Damage when hit by one. The amount of stagger damage dealt depends on the type of CC and is proportional to its duration. After being hit by a CC effect, the Boss will temporarily take less Stagger Damage from a CC of the same type. Effectively, this means that when you're just spamming one type of CC you don't need to spam any more of it than what you need to keep a normal enemy permanently CC-d. To stagger the Boss quickly you need to use as many different types of CC as possible. After the Boss is staggered it gains a certain amount of stacking Stagger Damage Reduction for the rest of the fight: Bosses naturally regain 1% of their Stagger HP every second and when that regen is combined with 90% Stagger Damage Reduction it becomes borderline impossible to Stagger the Boss again unless you bring a serious amount of crowd controls. The Earth Spike Druid excels in Boss battles and other small skirmishes, while being somewhat limited in its AoE and speedfarming potential. Once you acquire the build's core Uniques, its playstyle is among the simplest for Druids. By leveraging Grizzly Rage and stacking health, it's tanky enough to stand in the middle of the fight and continue dishing out damage, but prefers to stay at range to leverage Nature's Reach.

For Druids, these two caps are distributed in the following way: Read up more on Attack Speed in our Bosses are immune to Crowd Control (CC) effects and instead take Stagger Damage when hit by one. The amount of stagger damage dealt depends on the type of CC and is proportional to its duration. After being hit by a CC effect, the Boss will temporarily take less Stagger Damage from a CC of the same type. Effectively, this means that when you're just spamming one type of CC you don't need to spam any more of it than what you need to keep a normal enemy permanently CC-d. To stagger the Boss quickly you need to use as many different types of CC as possible. After the Boss is staggered it gains a certain amount of stacking Stagger Damage Reduction for the rest of the fight: Bosses naturally regain 1% of their Stagger HP every second and when that regen is combined with 90% Stagger Damage Reduction it becomes borderline impossible to Stagger the Boss again unless you bring a serious amount of crowd controls. The Earth Spike Druid excels in Boss battles and other small skirmishes, while being somewhat limited in its AoE and speedfarming potential. Once you acquire the build's core Uniques, its playstyle is among the simplest for Druids. By leveraging Grizzly Rage and stacking health, it's tanky enough to stand in the middle of the fight and continue dishing out damage, but prefers to stay at range to leverage Nature's Reach.
