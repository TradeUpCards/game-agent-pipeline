Let's jump in and see what it's all about! Season 6 is the . It features the faction which hunts Realmwalkers, massive behemoths that roam outdoor zones and beckon Mephisto's hellspawn. Participate in these zone events and take down the Realmwalkers to spawn a portal to a Seething Realm. There you can acquire Seething Opals, new consumables that stack with Elixirs for a XP buff and the chance to gather extra rewards when defeating enemies. The types of Opals are: Use these Opals at all times to earn reputation with the faction and unlock further rewards. Combo Points - Use Basic Skills to amplify your next Core Skill. This build starts out with this to gain the Attack Speed buff from , then switches to setup is unlocked. Use the slider to see the progression steps. At around Paragon 200, leveling slows down significantly and all important nodes and Glyph sockets should be unlocked. Afterwards, you can min/max your build with minor tweaks and by picking up additional smaller nodes. Some Glyph position swaps, board changes and other pathing adjustments may occur as you unlock your full potential. The setup displayed by default is the final version of the build before spending additional points that do not significantly impact your character's power. You can have up to two Runewords in your setup, each consisting of one Rune.

There are 4 separate Mercenaries to choose from, each with their own skill trees and abilities. You can have one (permanent) mercenary during solo play and a who assists you from time to time in certain situations. He provides us with extra all resistances and occasionally casts that gives us near invincibility for a short time. In addition, he prevents us from getting oneshot every 30 seconds thanks to . Beware that he's not present when playing in groups and make sure you remain resistance capped without him, e.g. by swapping gems, paragon nodes or using incenses. for extra crowd controls and stagger. To enable the Arrow Storms Rogue to perform optimally, hunt for these stats on your gear with good rolls and aim to them accordingly. Keep in mind that certain stats, such as Armor, Resistances, Extra Size Tempers, Attack Speed and more, have caps that may affect your priorities according to the items and Paragon points available at that moment. Before you dive into the Endgame with the Arrow Storms Rogue, take a look at this overview of the items used in the build. See below for further details about the different progression steps and variants. Some of your Skill Tree choices depend on what items are available to you. Keep in mind that while we can guarantee that everyone has access to the same Aspects, the exact progression is different for everyone. This section is designed to guide your Arrow Storms Rogue from a fresh level 60 into the very late endgame using the three variants . At the final step, you should be fully decked out with a great all-rounder build. From there, follow the other min/max variants if you want to optimize around certain activities such as If you are fresh in Torment 1 coming from a leveling guide, this is where you begin. Since only some Aspects can be guaranteed from Dungeon unlocks for the , focus on acquiring the additional aspects via gambling with The goal here is to progress through the Torment difficulties as you unlock Ancestrals, Paragon points, all and the most important to pilot this build. Some are used temporarily to fill slots that may be replaced with more items later on. This is the final version of the build's progression, including all regular , leaving you with a great all-rounder build for all content in the game. Additional variants use this as a baseline to optimize around certain activities. This Speedfarming variant optimizes the build for easy activities like Tiers after you have finished the variant and reached a plateau in your progression. This setup optimizes the build to push the highest possible Tiers in after you have finished the variant and reached a plateau in your progression. This is an alternative, more powerful way to play the build. Instead of , we focus on on top. The advantages are: Once a guide is released, many players have questions on why and how we are approaching certain choices. In this section you can find the answers to the questions that have been asked the most. The build works really well when you decimate everything in seconds, but may get overwhelmed if fights are long against high level monsters. There are several adjustments you can make when you have trouble with more difficult content: Rogues don't have many sources of but a good way to break out of crowd controls or trigger Generally hardcore and softcore share the same builds. Outside of being more prudent in your gameplay, you can also tweak the setup slightly to raise your survivability: gives us the most benefit as we really want to maximize both of these stats. Once you reliably cap out at 7 Arrow Storms, you can also go with for more survivability. Read up more on Attack Speed in our Bosses are immune to Crowd Control (CC) effects and instead take Stagger Damage when hit by one. The amount of stagger damage dealt depends on the type of CC and is proportional to its duration. After being hit by a CC effect, the Boss will temporarily take less Stagger Damage from a CC of the same type. Effectively, this means that when you're just spamming one type of CC you don't need to spam any more of it than what you need to keep a normal enemy permanently CC-d. To stagger the Boss quickly you need to use as many different types of CC as possible. After the Boss is staggered it gains a certain amount of stacking Stagger Damage Reduction for the rest of the fight: Bosses naturally regain 1% of their Stagger HP every second and when that regen is combined with 90% Stagger Damage Reduction it becomes borderline impossible to Stagger the Boss again unless you bring a serious amount of crowd controls. Coming soon. The Arrow Storms Rogue is a super fast, fun to play leveling build that scales very well into the lategame."

Read up more on Attack Speed in our Bosses are immune to Crowd Control (CC) effects and instead take Stagger Damage when hit by one. The amount of stagger damage dealt depends on the type of CC and is proportional to its duration. After being hit by a CC effect, the Boss will temporarily take less Stagger Damage from a CC of the same type. Effectively, this means that when you're just spamming one type of CC you don't need to spam any more of it than what you need to keep a normal enemy permanently CC-d. To stagger the Boss quickly you need to use as many different types of CC as possible. After the Boss is staggered it gains a certain amount of stacking Stagger Damage Reduction for the rest of the fight: Bosses naturally regain 1% of their Stagger HP every second and when that regen is combined with 90% Stagger Damage Reduction it becomes borderline impossible to Stagger the Boss again unless you bring a serious amount of crowd controls.

Read up more on Attack Speed in our Bosses are immune to Crowd Control (CC) effects and instead take Stagger Damage when hit by one. The amount of stagger damage dealt depends on the type of CC and is proportional to its duration. After being hit by a CC effect, the Boss will temporarily take less Stagger Damage from a CC of the same type. Effectively, this means that when you're just spamming one type of CC you don't need to spam any more of it than what you need to keep a normal enemy permanently CC-d. To stagger the Boss quickly you need to use as many different types of CC as possible. After the Boss is staggered it gains a certain amount of stacking Stagger Damage Reduction for the rest of the fight: Bosses naturally regain 1% of their Stagger HP every second and when that regen is combined with 90% Stagger Damage Reduction it becomes borderline impossible to Stagger the Boss again unless you bring a serious amount of crowd controls.

Keep in mind that certain stats, such as Armor, Resistances, Extra Size Tempers, Attack Speed and more, have caps that may affect your priorities according to the items and Paragon points available at that moment. Before you dive into the Endgame with the Arrow Storms Rogue, take a look at this overview of the items used in the build. See below for further details about the different progression steps and variants. Some of your Skill Tree choices depend on what items are available to you. Keep in mind that while we can guarantee that everyone has access to the same Aspects, the exact progression is different for everyone. This section is designed to guide your Arrow Storms Rogue from a fresh level 60 into the very late endgame using the three variants .

This is the final version of the build's progression, including all regular , leaving you with a great all-rounder build for all content in the game. Additional variants use this as a baseline to optimize around certain activities. This Speedfarming variant optimizes the build for easy activities like Tiers after you have finished the variant and reached a plateau in your progression.

Read up more on Attack Speed in our Bosses are immune to Crowd Control (CC) effects and instead take Stagger Damage when hit by one. The amount of stagger damage dealt depends on the type of CC and is proportional to its duration. After being hit by a CC effect, the Boss will temporarily take less Stagger Damage from a CC of the same type. Effectively, this means that when you're just spamming one type of CC you don't need to spam any more of it than what you need to keep a normal enemy permanently CC-d. To stagger the Boss quickly you need to use as many different types of CC as possible. After the Boss is staggered it gains a certain amount of stacking Stagger Damage Reduction for the rest of the fight: Bosses naturally regain 1% of their Stagger HP every second and when that regen is combined with 90% Stagger Damage Reduction it becomes borderline impossible to Stagger the Boss again unless you bring a serious amount of crowd controls.
