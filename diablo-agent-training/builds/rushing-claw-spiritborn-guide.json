Each Torment difficulty adds a 250 armor and 25% all res penalty and it's recommended to keep both capped (1000 armor for survival, 3334 armor for damage through as early as possible, 70%+ res) at all times. As you unlock higher power gear, masterworking levels and more paragon points, you naturally scale your character into the higher difficulties and can start replacing some of these rolls with offensive or utility stats.

The build works really well when you decimate everything in seconds, but may get overwhelmed if fights are long against high level monsters.

Some of your Skill Tree choices depend on what items are available to you. Keep in mind that while we can guarantee that everyone has access to the same Aspects, the exact progression is different for everyone. This section is designed to guide your Spiritborn from a fresh level 60 into the very late endgame using the three variants If you are fresh in Torment 1 coming from a leveling guide, this is where you begin. Since only some Aspects can be guaranteed from Dungeon unlocks for the , focus on acquiring the additional aspects via gambling with Early on in your progression, focus on armor & resistances to survive. Each Torment difficulty adds a 250 armor and 25% all res penalty and it's recommended to keep both capped (1000 armor for survival, 3334 armor for damage through as early as possible, 70%+ res) at all times. As you unlock higher power gear, masterworking levels and more paragon points, you naturally scale your character into the higher difficulties and can start replacing some of these rolls with offensive or utility stats. The goal here is to progress through the Torment difficulties as you unlock Ancestrals, Paragon points, all and the most important to pilot this build. Some are used temporarily to fill slots that may be replaced with more items later on. As you upgrade your gear to ancestrals with more masterworking levels and reach higher paragon, you can focus more and more on replacing armor & resistance rolls with better stats, but ensure to stay capped at 1000 armor for survival, 3334 armor for damage through and 70%+ resistances for the difficulty you're currently in. This is the final version of the build's progression, including all regular , leaving you with a great all-rounder build for all content in the game.

Once a guide is released, many players have questions on why and how we are approaching certain choices. In this section you can find the answers to the questions that have been asked the most. The build works really well when you decimate everything in seconds, but may get overwhelmed if fights are long against high level monsters. There are several adjustments you can make when you have trouble with more difficult content: Generally hardcore and softcore share the same builds. Outside of being more prudent in your gameplay, you can also tweak the setup slightly to raise your survivability: Barrier Generation works with: Barrier Generation doesn't work with: Read up more on Attack Speed in our Bosses are immune to Crowd Control (CC) effects and instead take Stagger Damage when hit by one. The amount of stagger damage dealt depends on the type of CC and is proportional to its duration. After being hit by a CC effect, the Boss will temporarily take less Stagger Damage from a CC of the same type. Effectively, this means that when you're just spamming one type of CC you don't need to spam any more of it than what you need to keep a normal enemy permanently CC-d. To stagger the Boss quickly you need to use as many different types of CC as possible. After the Boss is staggered it gains a certain amount of stacking Stagger Damage Reduction for the rest of the fight: Bosses naturally regain 1% of their Stagger HP every second and when that regen is combined with 90% Stagger Damage Reduction it becomes borderline impossible to Stagger the Boss again unless you bring a serious amount of crowd controls. In the table below you can see how valueable your ranks on your gear are. Every 5 Ranks of its duration increases, resulting in higher overall damage. The early ranks are worth much more, than the later ranks, as seen in the \"Relative Increase %\" column."

Each Torment difficulty adds a 250 armor and 25% all res penalty and it's recommended to keep both capped (1000 armor for survival, 3334 armor for damage through as early as possible, 70%+ res) at all times. As you unlock higher power gear, masterworking levels and more paragon points, you naturally scale your character into the higher difficulties and can start replacing some of these rolls with offensive or utility stats. The goal here is to progress through the Torment difficulties as you unlock Ancestrals, Paragon points, all and the most important to pilot this build. Some are used temporarily to fill slots that may be replaced with more items later on. As you upgrade your gear to ancestrals with more masterworking levels and reach higher paragon, you can focus more and more on replacing armor & resistance rolls with better stats, but ensure to stay capped at 1000 armor for survival, 3334 armor for damage through and 70%+ resistances for the difficulty you're currently in.

The amount of stagger damage dealt depends on the type of CC and is proportional to its duration. After being hit by a CC effect, the Boss will temporarily take less Stagger Damage from a CC of the same type. Effectively, this means that when you're just spamming one type of CC you don't need to spam any more of it than what you need to keep a normal enemy permanently CC-d. To stagger the Boss quickly you need to use as many different types of CC as possible. After the Boss is staggered it gains a certain amount of stacking Stagger Damage Reduction for the rest of the fight: Bosses naturally regain 1% of their Stagger HP every second and when that regen is combined with 90% Stagger Damage Reduction it becomes borderline impossible to Stagger the Boss again unless you bring a serious amount of crowd controls.

Each Torment difficulty adds a 250 armor and 25% all res penalty and it's recommended to keep both capped (1000 armor for survival, 3334 armor for damage through as early as possible, 70%+ res) at all times. As you unlock higher power gear, masterworking levels and more paragon points, you naturally scale your character into the higher difficulties and can start replacing some of these rolls with offensive or utility stats. The goal here is to progress through the Torment difficulties as you unlock Ancestrals, Paragon points, all and the most important to pilot this build. Some are used temporarily to fill slots that may be replaced with more items later on. As you upgrade your gear to ancestrals with more masterworking levels and reach higher paragon, you can focus more and more on replacing armor & resistance rolls with better stats, but ensure to stay capped at 1000 armor for survival, 3334 armor for damage through and 70%+ resistances for the difficulty you're currently in. This is the final version of the build's progression, including all regular , leaving you with a great all-rounder build for all content in the game.

The build works really well when you decimate everything in seconds, but may get overwhelmed if fights are long against high level monsters. There are several adjustments you can make when you have trouble with more difficult content: Generally hardcore and softcore share the same builds. Outside of being more prudent in your gameplay, you can also tweak the setup slightly to raise your survivability: Barrier Generation works with: Barrier Generation doesn't work with: Read up more on Attack Speed in our Bosses are immune to Crowd Control (CC) effects and instead take Stagger Damage when hit by one. The amount of stagger damage dealt depends on the type of CC and is proportional to its duration. After being hit by a CC effect, the Boss will temporarily take less Stagger Damage from a CC of the same type. Effectively, this means that when you're just spamming one type of CC you don't need to spam any more of it than what you need to keep a normal enemy permanently CC-d. To stagger the Boss quickly you need to use as many different types of CC as possible. After the Boss is staggered it gains a certain amount of stacking Stagger Damage Reduction for the rest of the fight: Bosses naturally regain 1% of their Stagger HP every second and when that regen is combined with 90% Stagger Damage Reduction it becomes borderline impossible to Stagger the Boss again unless you bring a serious amount of crowd controls.

Each Torment difficulty adds a 250 armor and 25% all res penalty and it's recommended to keep both capped (1000 armor for survival, 3334 armor for damage through as early as possible, 70%+ res) at all times. As you unlock higher power gear, masterworking levels and more paragon points, you naturally scale your character into the higher difficulties and can start replacing some of these rolls with offensive or utility stats. The goal here is to progress through the Torment difficulties as you unlock Ancestrals, Paragon points, all and the most important to pilot this build. Some are used temporarily to fill slots that may be replaced with more items later on. As you upgrade your gear to ancestrals with more masterworking levels and reach higher paragon, you can focus more and more on replacing armor & resistance rolls with better stats, but ensure to stay capped at 1000 armor for survival, 3334 armor for damage through and 70%+ resistances for the difficulty you're currently in. This is the final version of the build's progression, including all regular , leaving you with a great all-rounder build for all content in the game.

The build works really well when you decimate everything in seconds, but may get overwhelmed if fights are long against high level monsters. There are several adjustments you can make when you have trouble with more difficult content: Generally hardcore and softcore share the same builds. Outside of being more prudent in your gameplay, you can also tweak the setup slightly to raise your survivability: Barrier Generation works with: Barrier Generation doesn't work with: Read up more on Attack Speed in our Bosses are immune to Crowd Control (CC) effects and instead take Stagger Damage when hit by one. The amount of stagger damage dealt depends on the type of CC and is proportional to its duration. After being hit by a CC effect, the Boss will temporarily take less Stagger Damage from a CC of the same type. Effectively, this means that when you're just spamming one type of CC you don't need to spam any more of it than what you need to keep a normal enemy permanently CC-d. To stagger the Boss quickly you need to use as many different types of CC as possible. After the Boss is staggered it gains a certain amount of stacking Stagger Damage Reduction for the rest of the fight: Bosses naturally regain 1% of their Stagger HP every second and when that regen is combined with 90% Stagger Damage Reduction it becomes borderline impossible to Stagger the Boss again unless you bring a serious amount of crowd controls.
