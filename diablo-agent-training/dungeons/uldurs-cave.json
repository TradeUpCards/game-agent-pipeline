    "content": "Uldur's Cave is straightforward and relatively easy to complete, with minimal backtracking. Be wary of the charging beasts and ranged bees, but with only an elite as a boss, this dungeon is fairly fast and efficient. First completion rewards you with 30 Renown and the Necromancer's , a strong offensive choice for Necromancer's utilizing both curses and Shadow Damage. While every dungeon has a somewhat randomized layout, there are patterns to where objectives and bosses are located. This map will help you identify those layouts so you can complete dungeons faster and maximize your XP and loot per hour! Reviewed by"
