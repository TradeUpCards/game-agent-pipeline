    "content": "Sirocco Caverns checks all the boxes for a great dungeon to farm loot and glyph experience. It's close to a waypoint, has high monster density, and doesn't require a boss kill. Each of its two zones are circular, but the objectives lead you to play them in a linear fashion. Upon first completion, players are rewarded with Renown and the Barbarian's , a crucial resource-generating aspect for almost all of their builds. While every dungeon has a somewhat randomized layout, there are patterns to where objectives and bosses are located. This map will help you identify those layouts so you can complete dungeons faster and maximize your XP and loot per hour! Reviewed by"
