    "content": "The first zone in Abandoned Mineworks typically requires a full clear to find all of the prisoners, but the spider hosts in that zone will keep the area feeling dense. The second zone has less favorable mob types but can be rushed by hunting down the priority targets. There's no boss in this dungeon, either, making it overall a top choice for speed farming glyph experience! On first clear, you'll be rewarded with the on all classes, a decent tool for both offense and defense. While every dungeon has a somewhat randomized layout, there are patterns to where objectives and bosses are located. This map will help you identify those layouts so you can complete dungeons faster and maximize your XP and loot per hour! Reviewed by"
