    "content": "Sunken Library is a dungeon in the northwest of Kehjistan. First completion of this dungeon rewards the player with Renown and the Sorcerer's key , which provides a massive damage bonus when applying hard crowd control. Though the mob types in this dungeon are fairly benign, each of the first two areas are split into opposite sides and require some amount of backtracking. This dungeon is okay to farm, but you may want to seek better options. While every dungeon has a somewhat randomized layout, there are patterns to where objectives and bosses are located. This map will help you identify those layouts so you can complete dungeons faster and maximize your XP and loot per hour! Reviewed by"
