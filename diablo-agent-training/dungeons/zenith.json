    "content": "Zenith is fast dungeon for groups, and a terrible dungeon for solo players. The main feature is the large, split cavern that requires you march 3 different Bloodstones to the center. As a solo player this layout has tons of backtracking and should be avoided. For Sorcerers, the offers an excellent early game way of getting resource back. While every dungeon has a somewhat randomized layout, there are patterns to where objectives and bosses are located. This map will help you identify those layouts so you can complete dungeons faster and maximize your XP and loot per hour! Reviewed by"
