These are dangerous debuffs, especially for hardcore! Make sure you keep an eye on your debuff bar. A wise strategy is to outlevel this dungeon because the enemies do not scale beyond level 70. The Animus Carriers and the boss here can be extremely challenging. Make sure you prepare survivability and pack a boss specific build and don't forget an elixir too for extra tankiness. While every dungeon has a somewhat randomized layout, there are patterns to where objectives and bosses are located. This map will help you identify those layouts so you can complete dungeons faster and maximize your XP and loot per hour! This dungeon is not accessible until you complete the campaign. This unlocks the Capstone Dungeon on Nightmare, World Tier 3 difficulty. This can be done solo, but goes by quicker with a group of friends. Travel to the Inarius statue in the center of to change your Reviewed by"
