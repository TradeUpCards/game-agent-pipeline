    "content": "With a wide array of dangerous mob types and a layout that necessitates backtracking, we don't recommend Halls of the Damned for farming. However, you can make this dungeon a little shorter by running directly north in the fourth zone, Osseus. There is no prerequisite to enter the boss room, so navigating the penultimate room well can save you time here. Completing the dungeon for the first time will reward you with 30 renown and the universally strong , so make sure to clear this once! While every dungeon has a somewhat randomized layout, there are patterns to where objectives and bosses are located. This map will help you identify those layouts so you can complete dungeons faster and maximize your XP and loot per hour! Reviewed by"
