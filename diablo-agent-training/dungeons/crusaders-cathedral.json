    "content": "Crusader's Cathedral is fairly linear if played correctly. The first zone is quick, as it requires minimal exploration and combat to combat to complete. In the second zone, stick to the edges of the map, searching for each of Blaspehemists in the carved-out corners of the Crusader Catacombs. Given the tight corridors that exist in both the cathedral and prison layouts, this dungeon is not recommended for farming. Clearing it for the first time will reward you with 30 Renown and the Druid's , a healthy boon to skill levels that doesn't require an offensive aspect slot. While every dungeon has a somewhat randomized layout, there are patterns to where objectives and bosses are located. This map will help you identify those layouts so you can complete dungeons faster and maximize your XP and loot per hour! Reviewed by"
