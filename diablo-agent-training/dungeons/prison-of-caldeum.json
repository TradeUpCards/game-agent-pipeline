    "content": "Prison of Caldeum has a high variance for speed of clear. This depends on how quickly you encounter the objective targets (both the Warden in the first zone and the Animus Carriers in the second zone). The prison layout adds difficulty, as some of these priority targets may be in cells or stuck in corners. The Animus Urn and boss room are found in the center of the Corrupted Depths. Overall, this dungeon is not recommended for farming. Clear it once for the renown and the Rogue's , a useful tool for Rogues utilizing While every dungeon has a somewhat randomized layout, there are patterns to where objectives and bosses are located.
