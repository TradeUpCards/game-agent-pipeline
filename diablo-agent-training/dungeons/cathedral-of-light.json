    "content": "Diablo 4's Endgame begins with completion of this Capstone Dungeon, the Cathedral of Light. Completing this capstone dungeon is required to unlock World Tier 3, Nightmare, and it offers your first significant challenge beyond the campaign. Until now, most enemies in the world have scaled to your level, but not these foes -- they are bound to level 50, no more, no less. A wise strategy is to outlevel this dungeon because the enemies do not scale beyond level 50. If you have trouble with the first boss, exit the dungeon and come back later because the final boss is a difficult challenge. Make sure you prepare survivability and pack a boss specific build and don't forget an elixir too for extra tankiness. The first boss fight has 4 mini bosses: . You can defeat these in any order, but beware that when you defeat one, they summon a horde of enemies to swarm you. Depending on your build, this might actually be a welcome relief and help fuel your damage. So, you need to personally determine if your fight will go better by bursting them down one at a time, or lowering their health until you try to defeat them all simultaneously. This is the true test of entry to World Tier 3: Nightmare. The boss is slow to start so you can slam him with tons of damage right at the start of the fight. He deals high damage but has clearly telegraphed attacks that can be dodged. Make sure you dodge them! The main problem is that he can quickly cast his special attack three times in a row. Make sure you keep your dodge or survivability skill off cooldown in preparation for his devastating attack, and you should be able to clean him up quickly. While every dungeon has a somewhat randomized layout, there are patterns to where objectives and bosses are located. This map will help you identify those layouts so you can complete dungeons faster and maximize your XP and loot per hour! This dungeon is not accessible until you complete the campaign. This unlocks the Capstone Dungeon on Veteran, World Tier 2 difficulty. This can be done solo, but goes by quicker with a group of friends.
