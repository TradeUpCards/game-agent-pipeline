    "content": "Deserted Underpass is a fast and simple dungeon to clear, making it a top choice for farming! We don't normally recommend dungeons with a \"Slay all enemies\" objective, but when those enemies are spider hosts, things change. Finding all Ward of Eyes may take some exploration, but the mob types throughout this dungeon are generally favorable. First completion of Deserted Underpass rewards you with Renown and the Necromancer's , a so-so option for Crowd Control specific to Iron Maiden. While every dungeon has a somewhat randomized layout, there are patterns to where objectives and bosses are located. This map will help you identify those layouts so you can complete dungeons faster and maximize your XP and loot per hour! Reviewed by"
