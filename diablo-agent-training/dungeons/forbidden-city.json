    "content": "Even though Forbidden City is one of the coolest looking dungeons in the entire game and is with blood, the is better saved for picking up at endgame. The monster types here also make it a poor choice for dungeon blasting, so we recommend completing this once you hit level 50+ for Renown alone. While every dungeon has a somewhat randomized layout, there are patterns to where objectives and bosses are located. This map will help you identify those layouts so you can complete dungeons faster and maximize your XP and loot per hour! Reviewed by"
