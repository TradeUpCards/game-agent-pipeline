    "content": "Komdor Temple is vast wide dungeon with 3 difficult elite mobs, and holds the Sorcerer's aspect, . It's a fast completion but better with a group because you can split farm the 3 elites before dashing into the boss room. Solo can be a bit of a chore, as there is much backtracking to do to get from section to section of the dungeon. While every dungeon has a somewhat randomized layout, there are patterns to where objectives and bosses are located. This map will help you identify those layouts so you can complete dungeons faster and maximize your XP and loot per hour! Reviewed by"
