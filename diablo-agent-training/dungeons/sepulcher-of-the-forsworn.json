    "content": "The layout of Sepulcher of the Forsworn is far from preferable, causing you to fully explore the first zone to find all the Animus Carriers. The second zone is equally frustrating when searching for the Demonic Corruptions. In addition, the mob types can prove dangerous. This dungeon can be avoided after your first clear, which will reward you with Renown and the for Golemancers. While every dungeon has a somewhat randomized layout, there are patterns to where objectives and bosses are located. This map will help you identify those layouts so you can complete dungeons faster and maximize your XP and loot per hour! This dungeon is not accessible until you cleanse out the evil in . This unlocks the Dungeon along with potential vendors and a waypoint. This can be done solo, but goes by quicker with a group of friends. Reviewed by"
