The Free the Prisoners objective here is rather annoying as the cages take 5 seconds to open as opposed to the typical 3 seconds. At least there's no boss to contend with! While every dungeon has a somewhat randomized layout, there are patterns to where objectives and bosses are located. This map will help you identify those layouts so you can complete dungeons faster and maximize your XP and loot per hour! Reviewed by"
