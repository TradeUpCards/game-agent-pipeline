This dungeon has a timed event before the boss and may be the furthest dungeon from a waypoint in the game, making it on the slower side for efficient farming. Clear it once for the renown and to unlock the Druid's , then leave it behind. While every dungeon has a somewhat randomized layout, there are patterns to where objectives and bosses are located. This map will help you identify those layouts so you can complete dungeons faster and maximize your XP and loot per hour! Reviewed by"
