    "content": "To complete this dungeon efficiently, follow the straight lined formed by the first zone. Once you reach the second, larger zone, stick to the edges and move counterclockwise around the area, killing each of the Keepers your encounter - you shouldn't need to clear the center part of the Hideout Corridors. The last Keeper drops a key needed to enter the boss room. Continue counterclockwise to find and defeat the Outlaw Sharpshooter. First completion will reward you with Renown and the Rogue's , a potent choice for Rogues utilizing imbuements and applying Vulnerable. While every dungeon has a somewhat randomized layout, there are patterns to where objectives and bosses are located. This map will help you identify those layouts so you can complete dungeons faster and maximize your XP and loot per hour! Reviewed by"
